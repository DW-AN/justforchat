TI  - Arterial pressure pulse wave separation analysis using a multi-Gaussian 
      decomposition model.
LID - 10.1088/1361-6579/ac6e56 [doi]
AB  - Objective.Methods for separating the forward-backward components from blood pulse 
      waves rely on simultaneously measured pressure and flow velocity from a target 
      artery site. Modelling approaches for flow velocity simplify the wave separation 
      analysis (WSA), providing a methodological and instrumentational advantage over 
      the former; however, current methods are limited to the aortic site. In this 
      work, a multi-Gaussian decomposition (MGD) modelled WSA (MGD(WSA)) is developed 
      for a non-aortic site such as the carotid artery. While the model is an 
      adaptation of the existing wave separation theory, it does not rely on the 
      information of measured or modelled flow velocity.Approach.The proposed model 
      decomposes the arterial pressure waveform using weighted and shifted 
      multi-Gaussians, which are then uniquely combined to yield the forward (P(F)(t)) 
      and backward (P(B)(t)) pressure wave. A study using the database of healthy 
      (virtual) subjects was used to evaluate the performance of MGD(WSA)at the carotid 
      artery and was compared against reference flow-based WSA methods.Main results.The 
      MGD modelled pressure waveform yielded a root-mean-square error (RMSE) < 0.35 
      mmHg. Reliable forward-backward components with a group average RMSE <2.5 mmHg 
      forP(F)(t) andP(B)(t) were obtained. When compared with the reference 
      counterparts, the pulse pressures (ΔP(F)and ΔP(B)), as well as reflection 
      quantification indices, showed a statistically significant strong correlation 
      (r > 0.96,p < 0.0001) and (r > 0.83,p < 0.0001) respectively, with an 
      insignificant (p > 0.05) bias.Significance.This study reports WSA for carotid 
      pressure waveforms without assumptions on flow conditions. The proposed method 
      has the potential to adapt and widen the vascular health assessment techniques 
      incorporating pulse wave dynamics.

TI  - Menopause influences aortic pulse pressure and pressure wave responses to 
      metaboreflex activation in women.
PG  - 1423-1429
LID - 10.1097/GME.0000000000002078 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Postmenopausal women (post-MW) have greater risk of heart failure due 
      to aortic pulsatile overload on the left ventricle associated with increased 
      backward wave pressure (Pb). Post-MW have exaggerated peripheral blood pressure 
      (BP) response to exercise mediated by metaboreflex (postexercise muscle ischemia 
      [PEMI]) overactivation. Increased forward wave pressure (Pf) and Pb are 
      determinants of aortic pulse pressure (PP) during isometric handgrip exercis 
      (IHG) in young adults. We hypothesized that aortic PP and pressure wave responses 
      to PEMI are augmented in nonhypertensive post-MW compared with premenopausal 
      women (pre-MW). METHODS: Aortic BP, Pf, Pb, and reflection magnitude were 
      assessed at rest and during IHG and PEMI by applanation tonometry in 15 pre-MW 
      and 16 post-MW. RESULTS: Aortic systolic BP during PEMI similarly increased in 
      both groups. The increase in diastolic BP was lower in post-MW (post-MW Δ6 ± 2 vs 
      pre-MW Δ11 ± 2 mm Hg, P < 0.05). Aortic PP (post-MW Δ8 ± 2 vs pre-MW Δ3 ± 2), Pf 
      (post-MW Δ6 ± 1 vs pre-MW Δ0 ± 1), and Pb (post-MW Δ5 ± 1 vs pre-MW Δ2 ± 1) 
      augmented during PEMI in post-MW ( P < 0.05 for all), but not in pre-MW. 
      Reflection magnitude increased during PEMI only in pre-MW (pre-MW Δ7 ± 2 vs 
      post-MW Δ-1 ± 2, P < 0.05) due to concurrent increases in Pf and Pb in post-MW. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Even in nonhypertensive postmenopausal women, increases in Pf and Pb 
      and decrease in aortic DBP are important factors that contribute to the augmented 
      aortic PP response to PEMI.

TI  - Exaggerated Aortic Pulse Pressure and Wave Amplitude During Muscle Metaboreflex 
      Activation in Type 2 Diabetes Patients.
PG  - 70-76
LID - 10.1093/ajh/hpz135 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Peripheral mean arterial pressure (MAP) responses to muscle 
      metaboreflex activation using postexercise muscle ischemia (PEMI) in type 2 
      diabetes patients (T2D) are contradictory. Given that aortic pulse pressure (PP) 
      and wave reflections are better indicators of cardiac load than peripheral MAP, 
      we evaluated aortic blood pressure (BP) and wave amplitude during PEMI. METHODS: 
      Aortic BP and pressure wave amplitudes were measured at rest and during PEMI 
      following isometric handgrip at 30% maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) in 16 T2D 
      and 15 controls. Resting aortic stiffness (carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity, 
      cfPWV) and fasting blood glucose (FBG) were measured. RESULTS: Increases in 
      aortic MAP (Δ26 ± 2 mmHg vs. Δ17 ± 2 mmHg), PP (Δ15 ± 2 mmHg vs. Δ10 ± 1 mmHg), 
      augmentation index (AIx) (Δ8.2 ± 1.0% vs. Δ4.5 ± 1.3%), augmented pressure (AP) 
      (Δ11 ± 1 mmHg vs. Δ5 ± 1 mmHg), forward (Pf) (Δ9 ± 1 mmHg vs. Δ5 ± 1 mmHg), and 
      backward pressure waves (Pb) (Δ10 ± 1 mmHg vs. Δ5 ± 1 mmHg) responses to PEMI 
      were greater in T2D than controls (P < 0.05). Aortic PP, but not MAP, response to 
      PEMI was correlated to Pf (r = 0.63, P < 0.001) and Pb (r = 0.82, P < 0.001) 
      responses and cfPWV (r = 0.37, P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Aortic BP and pressure 
      wave responses to muscle metaboreflex activation are exaggerated in T2D. Aortic 
      PP during PEMI was related to increased wave reflection, forward wave amplitude, 
      and aortic stiffness in T2D patients.

PG  - 190-206
LID - 10.1007/s10439-014-1087-4 [doi]
AB  - We reviewed existing methods for analyzing, in the time domain, physical 
      mechanisms underlying the patterns of blood pressure and flow waveforms in the 
      arterial system. These are wave intensity analysis and separations into several 
      types of waveforms: (i) forward- and backward-traveling, (ii) peripheral and 
      conduit, or (iii) reservoir and excess. We assessed the physical information 
      provided by each method and showed how to combine existing methods in order to 
      quantify contributions to numerically generated waveforms from previous cardiac 
      cycles and from specific regions and properties of the numerical domain: the 
      aortic root, arterial bifurcations and tapered vessels, peripheral reflection 
      sites, and the Windkessel function of the aorta. We illustrated our results with 
      numerical examples involving generalized arterial stiffening in a distributed 
      one-dimensional model or localized changes in the model parameters due to a 
      femoral stenosis, carotid stent or abdominal aortic aneurysm.

TI  - Obese and Type 2 Diabetic Youth Have Increased Forward and Backward Wave 
      Reflections.
PG  - 944-950
LID - 10.1161/ATVBAHA.120.315317 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Pulse wave analysis estimates arterial wave reflections relating to 
      left ventricular dysfunction and cardiovascular event risk in adults. Forward and 
      backward waves (Pf and Pb) may improve risk stratification for cardiovascular 
      events. Data in youth are lacking. We hypothesized that a significant difference 
      in wave reflections would be identified in young subjects with adverse 
      cardiovascular risk factors. Approach and Results: Vital signs and labs were 
      obtained in 551 patients aged 10 to 24 years who were lean (L=199), obese 
      (O=173), or had type 2 diabetes (T=179). Wave separation was performed. 
      Differences in cardiovascular risk factors and wave reflections were assessed 
      using ANOVA. General linear models were constructed to elucidate independent 
      predictors of wave reflections. O and T subjects had an adverse cardiovascular 
      risk profile versus L. O and T subjects had higher Pf and Pb versus L (P≤0.05). 
      When adjusted for adiposity and other cardiovascular risk factors, reflection 
      magnitude increased from L to O to T with higher T versus L values (P≤0.05) and 
      near-significant O versus L values (P=0.06). Adiposity and blood pressure were 
      major determinants of wave reflections. Pb influenced log left ventricular mass 
      index, log E/e', and log composite carotid intima-media thickness. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Adolescents and young adults with obesity and type 2 diabetes have altered 
      forward and backward wave reflections versus lean controls related to adiposity, 
      BP, and insulin levels. These parameters may help risk stratify patients with 
      adverse cardiovascular risk factors.

AB  - We explored the use of the augmentation index (AI) based on pulse wave analysis 
      (PWA) in the pulmonary circulation as a measure of wave reflection and arterial 
      stiffness in individuals with and without pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) 
      and chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH). Right heart 
      catheterization was performed using a pressure and Doppler flow sensor-tipped 
      catheter to obtain simultaneous pressure and flow velocity measurements in the 
      pulmonary artery in 10 controls, 11 PAH patients, and 11 CTEPH patients. PWA was 
      applied to the measured pressure, while wave intensity analysis (WIA) and wave 
      separation analysis (WSA) were performed using both the pressure and velocity to 
      determine the magnitudes and timings of reflected waves. Type C (AI < 0) pressure 
      waveform dominated in controls and type A (AI > 12%) waveform dominated in PAH 
      patients, while there was a mixture of types A, B, and C among CTEPH patients. AI 
      was greater and the inflection time shorter in CTEPH compared to PAH patients. 
      There was a poor correlation between AI and arterial wave speed as well as 
      measures of wave reflection derived from WIA and WSA. The infection point did not 
      match the timing of the backward compression wave in ~50% of the cases. In 
      patients with type C waveforms, the inflection time correlated well to the timing 
      of the late systolic forward decompression wave caused by ventricular relaxation. 
      In conclusion quantifying pulmonary arterial wave reflection and stiffness using 
      AI based on PWA may be inaccurate and should therefore be discouraged.

AB  - Reports on the contribution of aortic forward (Pf) and backward (Pb) wave 
      pressures to age-related increases in central aortic pulse pressure (PPc) have 
      been confounded by the use of participants receiving antihypertensive therapy. We 
      assessed the relative contribution of Pf and Pb to age-related increases in PPc 
      (radial applanation tonometry and SphygmoCor software using an assumed triangular 
      wave for wave separation analysis) in 892 community participants not receiving 
      antihypertensive therapy. We validated our results using aortic flow waves 
      (echocardiography) for wave separation analysis in 254 of these participants. In 
      multivariate regression models in those aged <50 years, adjustments for both Pb 
      and a Pf-independent measure of reflected wave function (RM = Pb/Pf), but not Pf 
      abolished the impact of age on PPc. However, in those aged >50 years, adjustments 
      for Pf (β-coefficient: 0.25 ± 0.06 vs. 0.74 ± 0.08; P < .0001) and Pb 
      (0.04 ± 0.04 vs. 0.74 ± 0.08; P < .0001), but not RM markedly decreased the 
      relationship between age and PPc. On product of coefficient mediation analysis, 
      whether assessed in men or in women, in those participants aged <50 years, 
      independent of several confounders and mean arterial pressure, Pb (P < .005), but 
      not Pf contributed to age-related increases in PPc. In contrast, in those 
      participants aged ≥50 years, independent of several confounders and mean arterial 
      pressure, Pb (P < .005) and Pf (P < .01) contributed to age-related increases in 
      PPc, and Pb effects were markedly diminished by adjustments for Pf (0.26 ± 0.002 
      vs. 0.52 ± 0.003 mm Hg per year, P < .0001 for comparison). In conclusion, 
      independent of the effects of antihypertensive therapy, aortic backward waves 
      contribute to age-related increases in aortic PPc across the adult lifespan, but 
      at an older age, this effect may be attributed in part to the impact of forward 
      on backward wave pressures.

TI  - Forward and backward wave morphology and central pressure augmentation in men and 
      women in the Framingham Heart Study.
PG  - 259-65
LID - 10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.114.03371 [doi]
AB  - Central pressure augmentation is associated with greater backward wave amplitude 
      and shorter transit time and is higher in women for reasons only partially 
      elucidated. Augmentation also is affected by left ventricular function and shapes 
      of the forward and backward waves. The goal of this study was to examine the 
      relative contributions of forward and backward wave morphology to central 
      pressure augmentation in men and women. From noninvasive measurements of central 
      pressure and flow in 7437 participants (4036 women) aged from 19 to 90 years 
      (mean age, 51 years), we calculated several variables: augmentation index, 
      backward wave arrival time, reflection factor, forward wave amplitude, forward 
      wave peak width, and slope of the backward wave upstroke. Linear regression 
      models for augmentation index, adjusted for height and heart rate, demonstrated 
      nonlinear relations with age (age: B=4.6±0.1%; P<0.001; age2: B=−4.2±0.1%; 
      P<0.001) and higher augmentation in women (B=4.5±0.4%; P<0.001; model R2=0.35). 
      Addition of reflection factor and backward wave arrival time improved model fit 
      (R2=0.62) and reduced the age coefficients: age (B=2.3±0.1%; P<0.001) and age2 
      (B=−2.2±0.1%; P<0.001). Addition of width of forward wave peak, slope of backward 
      wave upstroke, and forward wave amplitude further improved model fit (R2=0.75) 
      and attenuated the sex coefficient (B=1.9±0.2%; P<0.001). Thus, shape and 
      amplitude of the forward wave may be important correlates of augmentation index, 
      and part of the sex difference in augmentation index may be explained by forward 
      and backward wave morphology.

AB  - Aortic pulse wave velocity (PWV) and backward waves, as determined from wave 
      separation analysis, predict cardiovascular events beyond brachial blood 
      pressure. However, the extent to which these aortic hemodynamic variables 
      contribute independent of each other is uncertain. In 749 randomly selected 
      participants of African ancestry, we therefore assessed the extent to which 
      relationships between aortic PWV or backward wave pressures (Pb) (and hence 
      central aortic pulse pressure [PPc]) and left ventricular mass index (LVMI) occur 
      independent of each other. Aortic PWV, PPc, forward wave pressure (Pf), and Pb 
      were determined using radial applanation tonometry and SphygmoCor software and 
      LVMI using echocardiography; 44.5% of participants had an increased left 
      ventricular mass indexed to height(1.7). With adjustments for age, brachial 
      systolic blood pressure or PP, and additional confounders, PPc and Pb, but not 
      Pf, were independently related to LVMI and left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) in 
      both men and women. However, PWV was independently associated with LVMI in women 
      (partial r = 0.16, P < .001), but not in men (partial r = 0.03), and PWV was 
      independently associated with LVH in women (P < .05), but not in men (P = .07). 
      With PWV and Pb included in the same multivariate regression models, PWV (partial 
      r = 0.14, P < .005) and Pb (partial r = 0.10, P < .05) contributed to a similar 
      extent to variations in LVMI in women. In addition, with PWV and Pb included in 
      the same multivariate regression models, PWV (P < .05) and Pb (P < .02) 
      contributed to LVH in women. In conclusion, aortic PWV and Pb (and hence pulse 
      pressure) although both associated with LVMI and LVH produce effects which are 
      independent of each other.

AB  - Wave intensity analysis provides detailed insights into factors influencing 
      hemodynamics. However, wave intensity is not a conserved quantity, so it is 
      sensitive to diameter variations and is not distributed among branches of a 
      junction. Moreover, the fundamental relation between waves and hydraulic power is 
      unclear. We, therefore, propose an alternative to wave intensity called "wave 
      power," calculated via incremental changes in pressure and flow (dPdQ) and a 
      novel time-domain separation of hydraulic pressure power and kinetic power into 
      forward and backward wave-related components (ΠP±and ΠQ±). Wave power has several 
      useful properties:1) it is obtained directly from flow measurements, without 
      requiring further calculation of velocity;2) it is a quasi-conserved quantity 
      that may be used to study the relative distribution of waves at junctions; and3) 
      it has the units of power (Watts). We also uncover a simple relationship between 
      wave power and changes in ΠP±and show that wave reflection reduces transmitted 
      power. Absolute values of ΠP±represent wave potential, a recently introduced 
      concept that unifies steady and pulsatile aspects of hemodynamics. We show that 
      wave potential represents the hydraulic energy potential stored in a compliant 
      pressurized vessel, with spatial gradients producing waves that transfer this 
      energy. These techniques and principles are verified numerically and also 
      experimentally with pressure/flow measurements in all branches of a central 
      bifurcation in sheep, under a wide range of hemodynamic conditions. The proposed 
      "wave power analysis," encompassing wave power, wave potential, and wave 
      separation of hydraulic power provides a potent time-domain approach for 
      analyzing hemodynamics.

TI  - Forward and Backward Aortic Components and Reflection Indexes in Children and 
      Adolescents: Determinants and Role in High Pressure States.
PG  - 137-153
LID - 10.2174/1573402114666180413113910 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: High blood pressure states (HBP) would differ in wave components and 
      reflections indexes, which could associate clinical and prognostic implications. 
      The study aims: 1) to characterize the association of aortic wave components and 
      reflection parameters (backward [Pb], forward [Pf], Pb/Pf ratio and augmentation 
      index [AIx]) with demographic, anthropometric, hemodynamic and arterial 
      parameters in healthy children and adolescents; 2) to generate multivariate 
      prediction models for the associations, to contribute to understand the main 
      determinants of Pf, Pb, Pb/Pf and AIx; 3) to identify if differences in wave 
      reflection indexes observed in HBP could be explained by differences in the 
      analyzed parameters. METHODS: Healthy children and adolescents (n=816, females: 
      386; Age: 3-20 years) were studied. EVALUATIONS: central aortic pressure and wave 
      components (Pb, Pf, Pb/Pf and AIx determination with SphygmoCor [SCOR] and 
      Mobil-o-Graph [MOG]); anthropometric assessment; regional arterial stiffness 
      (carotid-femoral, carotid-radial pulse wave velocity [PWV] and PWV ratio); 
      carotid intima-media thickness; carotid and femoral distensbility; cardiac 
      output; systemic vascular resistances (SVR). Simple and multiple regression 
      models were constructed to determine aortic wave parameters; the main explanatory 
      variables. Normotensive and HBP groups were compared. Differences in wave 
      reflection indexes were analyzed before and after controlling for explanatory 
      variables. Equivalences between SphygmoCor and Mobil-O-Graph data were assessed 
      (correlation and Bland-Altman analyses). RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: There were 
      systematic and proportional differences between the data obtained with SphygmoCor 
      and Mobil-O-Graph devices. Heart rate (HR), peripheral pulse pressure, height and 
      weight were the variables that isolated (simple associations) or combined 
      (multiple associations), showed the major capability to explain interindividual 
      differences in Pf, Pb, Pb/Pf and AIx. Arterial stiffness also showed explanatory 
      capacity, being the carotid the artery with the major contribution. HBP 
      associated higher Pf, Pb, AIx and lower Pb/Pf ratio. Those findings were observed 
      together with higher weight, arterial stiffness and HR. After adjusting for 
      anthropometric characteristics, HR, cardiac output and SVR, the HBP group showed 
      greater Pf and Pb. Then, Pf and Pb characteristics associated with HBP would not 
      be explained by anthropometric or hemodynamic factors. Evaluating wave components 
      and reflection parameters could contribute to improve the comprehension and 
      management of HBP states.

TI  - Time to the peak of the aortic forward wave determines the impact of aortic 
      backward wave and pulse pressure on left ventricular mass.
PG  - 300-309
LID - 10.1097/HJH.0000000000001173 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To determine the degree to which an extended time to the peak of the aortic 
      forward wave or early wave reflection time enhance associations between aortic 
      backward wave pressure and hence central aortic pulse pressure (PPc) and left 
      ventricular mass index (LVMI). METHODS: In 701 adult participants from a 
      community sample either receiving no antihypertensive therapy or receiving 
      low-dose thiazide diuretic monotherapy for at least a year (the major therapy 
      employed), we assessed aortic haemodynamics (SphygmoCor software and wave 
      separation analysis; AtCor Medical, West Ryder, New South Wales, Australia) and 
      LVMI (echocardiography). RESULTS: An interaction between time to the peak of the 
      aortic forward wave and aortic backward wave pressure was independently 
      associated with aortic augmented pressure (P < 0.01), PPc (P < 0.005), LVMI 
      (P < 0.01), and LV hypertrophy (LVH; P = 0.01). The time to the peak of the 
      aortic forward wave-aortic backward wave pressure interaction translated into a 
      stepwise increase in the independent association between aortic backward wave 
      pressure and aortic augmented pressure or PPc across quartiles of time to the 
      peak of the aortic forward wave (P < 0.05 to < 0.0001 for comparison of slopes of 
      relations). Furthermore, the time to the peak of the aortic forward wave-aortic 
      backward wave pressure interaction translated into an increase in the independent 
      association between PPc or aortic backward wave pressure and LVMI (P < 0.05 
      to < 0.001 for comparison of slopes and strength of relations) or LVH (P < 0.05 
      for comparisons of odds ratios), but not between forward wave pressures and LVMI 
      or LVH across quartiles of time to the peak of the aortic forward wave. A 
      markedly better ability of aortic backward wave pressure and PPc, but not forward 
      wave pressures to detect LVH was noted in the highest as compared with the first 
      three quartiles of time to the peak of the aortic forward wave (P < 0.05). In 
      contrast, reflection time failed to influence the impact of aortic backward wave 
      pressure or PPc on LVMI. CONCLUSIONS: Time to the peak of the aortic forward 
      wave, but not early wave reflection markedly influences the impact of aortic 
      backward wave pressure and hence aortic pulse pressure on LVMI and LVH in adults.

TI  - Non-invasive assessment of ventriculo-arterial coupling using aortic wave 
      intensity analysis combining central blood pressure and phase-contrast 
      cardiovascular magnetic resonance.
PG  - 805-813
LID - 10.1093/ehjci/jez227 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Wave intensity analysis (WIA) in the aorta offers important clinical 
      and mechanistic insight into ventriculo-arterial coupling, but is difficult to 
      measure non-invasively. We performed WIA by combining standard cardiovascular 
      magnetic resonance (CMR) flow-velocity and non-invasive central blood pressure 
      (cBP) waveforms. METHODS AND RESULTS: Two hundred and six healthy volunteers (age 
      range 21-73 years, 47% male) underwent sequential phase contrast CMR (Siemens 
      Aera 1.5 T, 1.97 × 1.77 mm2, 9.2 ms temporal resolution) and supra-systolic 
      oscillometric cBP measurement (200 Hz). Velocity (U) and central pressure (P) 
      waveforms were aligned using the waveform foot, and local wave speed was 
      calculated both from the PU-loop (c) and the sum of squares method (cSS). These 
      were compared with CMR transit time derived aortic arch pulse wave velocity 
      (PWVtt). Associations were examined using multivariable regression. The peak 
      intensity of the initial compression wave, backward compression wave, and forward 
      decompression wave were 69.5 ± 28, -6.6 ± 4.2, and 6.2 ± 2.5 × 104 W/m2/cycle2, 
      respectively; reflection index was 0.10 ± 0.06. PWVtt correlated with c or cSS 
      (r = 0.60 and 0.68, respectively, P < 0.01 for both). Increasing age decade and 
      female sex were independently associated with decreased forward compression wave 
      (-8.6 and -20.7 W/m2/cycle2, respectively, P < 0.01) and greater wave reflection 
      index (0.02 and 0.03, respectively, P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: This novel 
      non-invasive technique permits straightforward measurement of wave intensity at 
      scale. Local wave speed showed good agreement with PWVtt, and correlation was 
      stronger using the cSS than the PU-loop. Ageing and female sex were associated 
      with poorer ventriculo-arterial coupling in healthy individuals.

TI  - Aortic Pulse Pressure Does Not Adequately Index Cardiovascular Risk 
      Factor-Related Changes in Aortic Stiffness and Forward Wave Pressure.
PG  - 981-987
LID - 10.1093/ajh/hpy061 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Through the impact of conventional risk factors on arteries, several 
      changes in aortic function contribute to cardiovascular events. It is 
      nevertheless uncertain whether these effects are accurately reflected by changes 
      in central aortic pulse pressure (PPc). We, therefore, aimed to determine the 
      extent to which relations between modifiable risk factors and aortic function 
      translate into increases in PPc. METHODS: In 1,232 black South Africans from the 
      South West Township (SOWETO) of Johannesburg, we determined risk factors and 
      aortic function from carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV), aortic PPc, 
      forward wave pressures (Pf), and reflected (backward) wave pressures (Pb) 
      (applanation tonometry and SphygmoCor software). RESULTS: With adjustments for 
      alternative risk factors and distending pressure (mean arterial pressure (MAP)), 
      diabetes mellitus (treatment or HbA1c > 6.5%, n = 151) was associated with an 
      increased PWV (7.10 ± 2.09 vs. 6.17 ± 2.00 m/s, P < 0.0001), and Pf (26 ± 8 vs. 
      24 ± 8 mm Hg, P < 0.005), but neither brachial PP (46 ± 14 vs. 45 ± 13, P = 
      0.19), PPc (36 ± 12 vs. 35 ± 11 mm Hg, P = 0.48), nor Pb (17 ± 6 vs. 17 ± 6 mm 
      Hg, P = 0.83). Moreover, independent of alternative risk factors and MAP, 
      uncontrolled hypertension (office blood pressure > 140/90 mm Hg, n = 433) was 
      associated with an increased Pf (26 ± 12 vs. 24 ± 10 mm Hg, P < 0.01), but not 
      with changes in brachial PP (45 ± 19 vs. 44 ± 17, P = 0.75), PPc (35 ± 16 vs. 35 
      ± 15 mm Hg, P = 0.93), or Pb (18 ± 8 vs. 17 ± 8 mm Hg, P = 0.46). CONCLUSIONS: 
      Neither brachial nor aortic PP are adequate indexes of relations between the 
      modifiable conventional risk factors, uncontrolled hypertension or diabetes 
      mellitus, and risk-related aortic functional changes.

AB  - Primary aldosteronism (PA) is hemodynamically independently associated with 
      arterial wall stiffness as assessed by pulse wave velocity (PWV) compared with 
      essential hypertension. Arterial wave reflection parameters derived from pulse 
      wave analysis, such as forward and backward wave amplitudes (Pf and Pb), are 
      promising vascular markers to predict cardiovascular outcomes in addition to PWV. 
      These vascular parameters have never been studied in patients with PA before. In 
      study part A, we prospectively enrolled 67 patients with PA and 132 patients with 
      essential hypertension. In study part B, another 54 patients with PA were 
      enrolled. Heart-carotid PWV was measured, and carotid pressure waveforms were 
      recorded to calculate Pf, Pb, and augmentation index at baseline (part A and B) 
      and 6 months after treatment (part B). The results showed that the patients with 
      PA had significantly higher Pf (P=0.001), Pb (P=0.01), and PWV (P=0.021) than the 
      patients with essential hypertension. In univariate correlation analysis, both 
      log Pf and Pb were significantly correlated with age, office blood pressure, 
      serum potassium level, log PWV, and the presence of PA. However, only Pb was 
      significantly correlated with log plasma renin activity and log aldosterone to 
      renin ratio. In multivariate analysis, log Pf was significantly correlated with 
      the presence of PA (P=0.001), male sex, age, and mean arterial blood pressure. Pb 
      was significantly correlated with the presence of PA (P=0.031), age, and mean 
      arterial pressure. Six months after treatment, Pf and Pb decreased significantly. 
      In conclusion, the patients with PA had significantly increased wave reflections 
      compared with the patients with essential hypertension. Our results provide 
      clinical evidence of aldosterone-related extensive vascular dysfunction of the 
      arterial system.

TI  - Aortic backward waves rather than stiffness account for independent associations

AB  - A decreased aortic-to-brachial pulse pressure (PP) amplification, which is 
      independently associated with cardiovascular outcomes, may index several aortic 
      functional changes. However, that aortic functional change most likely to account 
      for this effect is uncertain. In 706 randomly selected community participants of 
      African ancestry with a mean age of 44.4 ± 18.2 years, we assessed aortic 
      function using radial applanation tonometry and SphygmoCor software (including 
      forward [Pf] and backward [Pb] wave separation analysis assuming a triangular 
      flow waveform) and left ventricular mass index (LVMI) (echocardiography). In 
      multivariate models with the inclusion of brachial PP, 1/PP amplification 
      (partial r = 0.12, P < .005), reflected wave pressures (partial r = 0.09, 
      P < .05), and aortic pulse wave velocity (PWV; partial r = 0.09, P < .05) were 
      independently associated with LVMI. Similarly, in multivariate models with the 
      inclusion of brachial PP, 1/PP amplification (P < .005), the reflected wave 
      pressure (P < .01), and aortic PWV (P < .01) were independently associated with 
      LVH. With adjustments for reflected wave pressures, the brachial PP-independent 
      relationships between 1/PP amplification and LVMI or LVH were abolished (P > .08 
      for both). However, adjustments for PWV failed to modify brachial PP-independent 
      relations between 1/PP amplification and LVMI or LVH. Similar results were noted 
      when brachial systolic blood pressure rather than PP was included in regression 
      models and in sensitivity analysis conducted in participants not receiving 
      antihypertensive therapy. In conclusion, the independent relations between the 
      reciprocal of aortic-to-brachial PP amplification and LVMI or LVH in a largely 
      young to middle-aged sample are accounted for by variations in backward wave 
      pressures rather than aortic stiffness.

TI  - Excess pressure but not pulse wave velocity is associated with cognitive function 
      impairment: a community-based study.
PG  - 1776-1785
LID - 10.1097/HJH.0000000000003217 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (cf-PWV), an index of mainly 
      distal aortic stiffness, has been inconsistently associated with cognitive 
      function. Excess pressure, derived from the arterial reservoir-excess pressure 
      analysis, may integrate the pulsatile load of the proximal aorta. The present 
      study examined whether increased excess pressure is associated with cognitive 
      function impairment in community adults. METHODS: A total of 992 community 
      participants (69.5% females; mean age: 67.3 years; education 13.6 years) without 
      cerebrovascular disease or dementia received the Montreal Cognitive Assessment 
      (MoCA) to evaluate global cognition. Arterial reservoir and excess pressure, 
      arterial stiffness, and wave reflections were assessed, using carotid tonometry 
      and aortic Doppler flowmetry. RESULTS: Excess pressure integral (XSPI), 
      percentage XSPI, cf-PWV, characteristic impedance (Zc), and forward and backward 
      pressure amplitude (Pf, Pb, respectively) were significantly higher in 197 
      participants (19.9%) with a low MoCA score (<26 or <25, depending on level of 
      education). In multivariable analyses, XSPI (standardized odds ratio, 95% 
      confidence interval, 1.30, 1.06-1.59), and percentage XSPI (1.27, 1.06-1.52) but 
      not cf-PWV (1.04, 0.85-1.26) were significantly associated with a low MoCA. 
      Further analysis revealed that Pf and Zc were the major determinants of XSPI 
      (partial R2: Pf = 0.656, Zc = 0.467) and percentage XSPI (Pf = 0.459, 
      Zc = 0.371). In contrast, age, instead of Pf and Zc, was the major determinant of 
      cf-PWV (partial R2: age = 0.187). CONCLUSIONS: Excess pressure (XSPI/percentage 
      XSPI), mainly determined by the pulsatile hemodynamics of the proximal aorta, was 
      significantly associated with cognitive function impairment in middle-aged and 
      elderly community adults.

      wave velocity, PWV), peripheral vascular resistances (PVR) and net and relative 
      contributions of reflected waves to the aortic pulse amplitude. We included 154 
      subjects (mean age 11; range 4-16 years) assigned to one of two groups: normal 
      peripheral BP (NBP, n = 101), defined as systolic and diastolic BP < 90th 
      percentile, or high BP (HBP, n = 53), defined as average systolic and/or 
      diastolic BP levels ≥90th percentile (curves for sex, age and body height). The 
      HBP group included children with hypertensive and pre-hypertensive BP levels. 
      After a first analysis, groups were compared excluding obese and dyslipidemic 
      children. Peripheral and central aortic BP, PWV and pulse wave-derived parameters 
      (augmentation index, forward and backward wave components' amplitude) were 
      measured using gold-standard techniques, applanation tonometry (SphygmoCor) and 
      oscillometry (Mobil-O-Graph). Independent of the presence of dyslipidemia and/or 
      obesity, aortic systolic and pulse BP were higher in HBP than in NBP children. 
      The increase in central BP could not be explained by an increase in the relative 
      contribution of reflections to the aortic pressure wave, higher PVR or by an 
      augmented peripheral reflection coefficient. Instead, the rise in central BP 
      would be explained by an increase in the amplitude of both incident and reflected 
      wave components.

TI  - Dominance of the forward compression wave in determining pulsatile components of 
      blood pressure: similarities between inotropic stimulation and essential 
      hypertension.
PG  - 1116-23
LID - 10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.114.04050 [doi]
AB  - Pulsatile components of blood pressure may arise from forward (ventricular 
      generated) or backward wave travel in the arterial tree. The objective of this 
      study was to determine the relative contributions of forward and backward waves 
      to pulsatility. We used wave intensity and wave separation analysis to determine 
      pulsatile components of blood pressure during inotropic and vasopressor 
      stimulation by dobutamine and norepinephrine in normotensive subjects and 
      compared pulse pressure components in hypertensive (mean±SD, 48.8±11.3 years; 
      165±26.6/99±14.2 mm Hg) and normotensive subjects (52.2±12.6 years; 
      120±14.2/71±8.2 mm Hg). Dobutamine (7.5 μg/kg per minute) increased the forward 
      compression wave generated by the ventricle and increased pulse pressure from 
      36.8±3.7 to 59.0±3.4 mm Hg (mean±SE) but had no significant effect on mean 
      arterial pressure or the midsystolic backward compression wave. By contrast, 
      norepinephrine (50 ng/kg per minute) had no significant effect on the forward 
      compression wave but increased the midsystolic backward compression wave. Despite 
      this increase in the backward compression wave, and an increase in mean arterial 
      pressure, norepinephrine increased central pulse pressure less than dobutamine 
      (increases of 22.1±3.8 and 7.2±2.8 mm Hg for dobutamine and norepinephrine, 
      respectively; P<0.02). An elevated forward wave component (mean±SE, 50.4±3.4 
      versus 35.2±1.8 mm Hg, in hypertensive and normotensive subjects, respectively; 
      P<0.001) accounted for approximately two thirds of the total difference in 
      central pulse pressures between hypertensive and normotensive subjects. Increased 
      central pulse pressure during inotropic stimulation and in essential hypertension 
      results primarily from the forward compression wave.

LID - e026603
AB  - Background Waveform parameters provide approximate data about aortic wave 
      reflection. However, their association with cardiovascular events remains 
      controversial and their role in cardiovascular prediction is unknown. Methods and 
      Results We analyzed participants aged between 40 and 69 from the population-based 
      CARTaGENE cohort. Baseline pulse wave analysis (central pulse pressure, 
      augmentation index) and wave separation analysis (forward pressure, backward 
      pressure, reflection magnitude) parameters were derived from radial artery 
      tonometry. Associations between each parameter and major adverse atherosclerotic 
      events (MACE; cardiovascular death, stroke, myocardial infarction) were obtained 
      using adjusted Cox models. The incremental predictive value of each parameter 
      compared with the 10-year atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease score alone was 
      assessed using hazard ratios, c-index differences, continuous net 
      reclassification indexes, and integrated discrimination indexes. From 17 561 
      eligible patients, 2315 patients had a MACE during a median follow-up of 
      10.1 years. Central pulse pressure, forward pressure, and backward pressure, but 
      not augmentation index and reflection magnitude, were significantly associated 
      with MACE after full adjustment. All parameters except forward pressure 
      statistically improved MACE prediction compared with the atherosclerotic 
      cardiovascular disease score alone. The greatest prediction improvement was seen 
      with augmentation index and reflection magnitude but remained small in magnitude. 
      These 2 parameters enhanced predictive performance more strongly in patients with 
      low baseline atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease scores. Up to 5.7% of 
      individuals were reclassified into a different risk stratum by adding waveform 
      parameters to atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease scores. Conclusions Some 
      waveform parameters are independently associated with MACEs in a population-based 
      cohort. Augmentation index and reflection magnitude slightly improve risk 
      prediction, especially in patients at low cardiovascular risk.

      Pressure Wave Transmission in Essential Hypertension.
PG  - 1366-1372
LID - 10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.119.13387 [doi]
AB  - Arterial stiffness and impedance gradients are known to influence pressure wave 
      propagation and macrovascular-microvascular interactions. We studied the 
      association between the carotid-femoral arterial stiffness gradient and the 
      systemic reflection coefficient (N=393); of this population, 246 also underwent 
      assessment of forward/backward pressure wave propagation and microvascular 
      pulsatile pressure transmission (MPPT). Hemodynamic parameters were measured 
      noninvasively. From peripheral vascular resistance and characteristic impedance, 
      we estimated the systemic reflection coefficient and MPPT on peripheral and 
      cardiac microcirculation in age-matched, sex-matched and body mass index-matched 
      individuals with (n=147) or without (n=98) hypertension. The arterial stiffness 
      gradient, systemic reflection coefficient, and correlations between the arterial 
      stiffness gradient and age or blood pressure were similar in both populations. 
      MPPT was higher in hypertension (P<0.0001), and the subendocardial viability 
      (Buckberg) index lower (P<0.0001). In both populations, the systemic reflection 
      coefficient and arterial stiffness gradient were significantly associated with 
      changes in MPPT and the subendocardial viability index. Despite similar systemic 
      reflection coefficients, the carotid reflected pressure and MPPT were higher in 
      hypertension. Maintaining the systemic reflection coefficient within normal 
      ranges was, therefore, insufficient to compensate for higher carotid forward 
      pressure waves which, in hypertension, were associated with increased aortic 
      stiffness (P<0.0001) and higher stroke volume (P=0.0365). Independently of 
      cardiovascular risk, hypertension-induced changes have a weighted effect on MPPT, 
      although insufficient to compensate for increased forward pressure waves. In 
      hypertension, elevated aortic stiffness negatively affects the arterial stiffness 
      gradient and systemic reflection coefficient but positively affects forward 
      pressure.

AB  - AIMS: To determine whether brachial blood pressure (BP)-independent relations 
      between aortic pressure and cardiovascular damage are better explained by 
      reflected (backward) (Pb) or forward (Pf) wave pressure effects. METHODS: In 1174 
      participants from a community of African ancestry, we assessed central aortic 
      pulse pressure (PPc), Pb, and Pf (radial applanation tonometry, SphygmoCor) as 
      well as left ventricular mass index (LVMI) (n = 786), aortic pulse wave velocity 
      (PWV) (n = 1019), carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) (n = 578), transmitral 
      early-to-late left ventricular diastolic velocity (E/A) (n = 779) and estimated 
      glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (n = 1174). RESULTS: Independent of mean 
      arterial pressure and confounders, PPc, and both Pb and Pf were associated with 
      end-organ measures or damage (P < 0.05 to P < 0.0001). With adjustments for 
      brachial PP and confounders, Pb remained directly associated with LVMI (partial 
      r = 0.09, P < 0.01), PWV (partial r = 0.28, P < 0.0001), and IMT (partial 
      r = 0.28, P < 0.0001), and inversely associated with E/A (partial r = -0.31, 
      P < 0.0001) and eGFR (partial r = -0.14, P < 0.0001). Similar relations were 
      noted with the presence of end-organ damage (P < 0.05 to P < 0.0001). In 
      contrast, with adjustments for brachial PP and confounders, Pf no longer retained 
      direct relations with LVMI, PWV, and IMT or inverse relations with E/A and eGFR. 
      Adjustments for Pb, but not Pf, diminished brachial PP-independent relationships 
      between PPc and end-organ measures. Independent relations between Pb, but not Pf 
      and end-organ measures, were largely attributed to Pb accounting for most of the 
      variation in brachial-to-aortic PP amplification. CONCLUSIONS: In communities of 
      African ancestry, brachial BP-independent relations between aortic pressure and 
      end-organ changes are largely attributed to an impact of reflected rather than 
      forward wave pressures.

TI  - Localization of Arterial Bleeds Using Pulse Wave Reflections.
PG  - 346-350
LID - 10.1093/milmed/usaa371 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Localization of internal arterial bleeds is necessary for treatment 
      in the battlefield. In this article, we describe a novel approach that utilizes 
      pulse wave reflections generated by a bleed to locate it. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 
      To demonstrate our approach, velocity and diameter waveforms in the presence of 
      bleeds were simulated using the 1D wave propagation equations in a 
      straight-vessel model of the human thoracic aorta. The simulated waveforms were 
      then decomposed into forward and backward components using wave intensity 
      analysis. Reflections arising from the bleed were identified from the decomposed 
      waveforms. RESULTS: Reflection generated by the bleed introduced a new feature in 
      the backward component, compared to the normal, no-bleed condition. The bleed 
      location could be determined from the time delay between this reflection feature 
      and the forward wave creating it, and the pulse wave velocity in the vessel. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study could be utilized by ultrasound for 
      hemorrhage localization.

TI  - Determination of aortic pulse transit time based on waveform decomposition of 
      radial pressure wave.
PG  - 20154
LID - 10.1038/s41598-021-99723-w [doi]
LID - 20154
AB  - Carotid-femoral pulse transit time (cfPTT) is a widely accepted measure of 
      central arterial stiffness. The cfPTT is commonly calculated from two 
      synchronized pressure waves. However, measurement of synchronized pressure waves 
      is technically challenging. In this paper, a method of decomposing the radial 
      pressure wave is proposed for estimating cfPTT. From the radial pressure wave 
      alone, the pressure wave can be decomposed into forward and backward waves by 
      fitting a double triangular flow wave. The first zero point of the second 
      derivative of the radial pressure wave and the peak of the dicrotic segment of 
      radial pressure wave are used as the peaks of the fitted double triangular flow 
      wave. The correlation coefficient between the measured wave and the estimated 
      forward and backward waves based on the decomposition of the radial pressure wave 
      was 0.98 and 0.75, respectively. Then from the backward wave, cfPTT can be 
      estimated. Because it has been verified that the time lag estimation based on of 
      backward wave has strong correlation with the measured cfPTT. The corresponding 
      regression function between the time lag estimation of backward wave and measured 
      cfPTT is y = 0.96x + 5.50 (r = 0.77; p < 0.001). The estimated cfPTT using radial 
      pressure wave decomposition based on the proposed double triangular flow wave is 
      more accurate and convenient than the decomposition of the aortic pressure wave 
      based on the triangular flow wave. The significance of this study is that 
      arterial stiffness can be directly estimated from a noninvasively measured radial 
      pressure wave.

TI  - Arterial stiffness and blood pressure are similar in naturally menstruating and 
      oral contraceptive pill-using women during the higher hormone phases.
PG  - 374-382
LID - 10.1113/EP090151 [doi]
AB  - NEW FINDINGS: What is the central question of this study? Are there differences 
      in blood pressure, arterial stiffness and indices of pressure waveforms between 
      young oral contraceptive pill-using and naturally menstruating women during lower 
      and higher hormone phases of their cycles? What is the main finding and its 
      importance? Blood pressure, arterial stiffness and indices of pressure waveforms 
      are influenced similarly by exogenous and endogenous hormones. However, lower 
      levels of exogenous hormones moderately increase blood pressure among oral 
      contraceptive pill-using women. ABSTRACT: Elevations in blood pressure (BP) are 
      understood as having a bidirectional relationship with stiffening of central and 
      peripheral arteries. Arterial stiffness is mitigated by oestrogen, which aides in 
      arterial vasorelaxation. To evaluate whether BP, stiffness, and pressure 
      waveforms were different between young healthy naturally menstruating (non-OCP) 
      and oral contraceptive pill (OCP)-using women, we measured brachial and aortic 
      BPs, carotid-to-femoral pulse wave velocity, carotid β-stiffness, elastic 
      modulus, central augmentation index and augmentation index normalized to a heart 
      rate of 75 bpm, and forward and backward pressure waveforms in 22 women (22 (1) 
      years, OCP: n = 12). To assess phasic differences, women were studied during the 
      early follicular (≤5 days of menstruation onset) and early luteal (4 (2) days 
      post-ovulation) phases of non-OCP and compared to the placebo pill (≤5 days of 
      onset) and active pill (≤5 days of highest-dose active pill) phases of OCP. 
      During the lower hormone phases, OCP users had significantly higher brachial 
      systolic blood pressure (SBP) (119.3 (8.3) vs. 110.2 (8.3) mmHg, P = 0.02) and 
      aortic SBP (104.10 (7.44) vs. 96.80 (6.39) mmHg, P = 0.03) as compared to non-OCP 
      users; however, during the higher hormone phases, there were no differences in 
      measures of brachial or aortic BP, arterial stiffness, or indices of BP waveforms 
      between OCP and non-OCP users (P ≥ 0.05). In conclusion, exogenous and endogenous 
      hormones have similar influences on BP and arterial stiffness; however, lower 
      levels of exogenous hormones augment both central and peripheral BPs.

TI  - Increased Backward Wave Pressures Rather than Flow Explain Age-Dependent Heart 
      Rate Effects on Central, But not Peripheral Arterial Pressure.
PG  - 435-446
LID - 10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.121.18271 [doi]
AB  - Through both backward (Pb) and forward (Pf) wave effects, a lower heart rate (HR) 
      associates with increased central (PPc), beyond brachial pulse pressure (PP). 
      However, the relative contribution to Pf of aortic flow (Q) versus re-reflection 
      of Pb, has not been determined. Using central pressure, aortic velocity and 
      diameter measurements in the outflow tract (echocardiography), we constructed 
      central pressure waveforms that account for the relative contribution of Q versus 
      re-reflection to Pf. We thus evaluated the mechanisms of HR-PPc relations in a 
      community sample (n=824) and the impact of age thereon. Inverse HR-PPc 
      (P<0.0001), but not HR-brachial PP (P=0.064) relations were noted. The slope of 
      HR-PPc relation was increased in older adults (P<0.005). HR was inversely 
      associated with ventricular filling time, ejection duration, stroke volume, and 
      peak Pf (P<0.001 to P<0.0001). However, an increased Q and hence pressures 
      generated by the product of aortic characteristic impedance and Q did not account 
      for Pf effects. Age-dependent HR-PPc and Pf relations were both accounted for by 
      enhanced Pb (P<0.0001) with an increased Pf mediated by increments in wave 
      re-reflection (P<0.0001). The lack of impact of ejection duration on PPc was 
      explained by an increased time to peak Pb (P<0.0001). In conclusion, increases in 
      PPc and Pf at a decreased HR are accounted for by an enhanced Pb rather than by a 
      prolonged ejection or filling duration and hence flow (Q). These effects at a 
      young-to-middle age are of little clinical significance, but at an older age, are 
      of clinical importance.

TI  - Comprehensive assessment of coronary pulse wave velocity in anesthetized pigs.
PG  - e14424
LID - 10.14814/phy2.14424 [doi]
LID - e14424
AB  - BACKGROUND: Coronary stiffness represents a new paradigm for interventional 
      cardiology and can be assessed by coronary pulse wave velocity (CoPWV). Assessing 
      CoPWV is complex because of the coexistence of backward and forward waves. 
      OBJECTIVES: Evaluate the feasibility, repeatability, and capacity of methods 
      assessing CoPWV to detect predictable velocity changes. METHODS: CoPWV was 
      measured from distal and proximal pressure guidewires in the left anterior 
      descending artery of 10 pigs under general anesthesia. Four methods were studied: 
      the tangent intersection method applied to the forward (FW) and backward (BK) 
      waves, as well as the dicrotic notch (DIC) and template matching (TM) methods. 
      All were evaluated at baseline, during various arterial pressure and heart rate 
      conditions, during simulated flow limitation (balloon inflation), and after 
      increasing coronary stiffness (stent insertion). RESULTS: All the methods were 
      significantly different between them (p ≤ .05) showing a systematic trend toward 
      higher CoPWV when compared to the FW method (.05 < p<.10). Results were found to 
      be significantly correlated only between the BK and FW methods and between the 
      DIC and TM methods (p ≤ .05). CoPWV increased with arterial pressure increase, 
      this increase being significant for the DIC and TM methods and partly for the FW 
      method (p ≤ .05). Conversely, heart rate had no systematic impact on CoPWV. The 
      lowest variability was found for the DIC and TM methods (p ≤ .05). Only the BK 
      and TM methods remained applicable during flow limitation; stent increased CoPWV 
      when measured by the BK method only (p ≤ .05). CONCLUSION: Although CoPWV can be 
      measured by various methods, the BK and TM methods seem the most appropriate for 
      clinical studies.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Arterial stiffness and wave reflection parameters assessed from both 
      invasive and non-invasive pressure and flow readings are used as surrogates for 
      ventricular and vascular load. They have been reported to predict adverse 
      cardiovascular events, but clinical assessment is laborious and may limit 
      widespread use. This study aims to investigate measures of arterial stiffness and 
      central hemodynamics provided by arterial tonometry alone and in combination with 
      aortic root flows derived by echocardiography against surrogates derived by a 
      mathematical pressure and flow model in a healthy middle-aged cohort. METHODS: 
      Measurements of carotid artery tonometry and echocardiography were performed on 
      2226 ASKLEPIOS study participants and parameters of systemic hemodynamics, 
      arterial stiffness and wave reflection based on pressure and flow were measured. 
      In a second step, the analysis was repeated but echocardiography derived flows 
      were substituted by flows provided by a novel mathematical model. This was 
      followed by a quantitative method comparison. RESULTS: All investigated 
      parameters showed a significant association between the methods. Overall 
      agreement was acceptable for all parameters (mean differences: -0.0102 (0.033 SD) 
      mmHg*s/ml for characteristic impedance, 0.36 (4.21 SD) mmHg for forward pressure 
      amplitude, 2.26 (3.51 SD) mmHg for backward pressure amplitude and 0.717 (1.25 
      SD) m/s for pulse wave velocity). CONCLUSION: The results indicate that the use 
      of model-based surrogates in a healthy middle aged cohort is feasible and 
      deserves further attention.

TI  - Organ-Specific, Age-Dependent Associations of Steady-State Pressures and 
      Pulsatile Pressure Wave Components With End-Organ Measures.
PG  - 272-281
LID - 10.1093/ajh/hpy171 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The contribution of steady-state pressures and the forward (Pf) and 
      backward (reflected) (Pb) wave pressure components of pulse pressure to risk 
      prediction have produced contrasting results. We hypothesized that the 
      independent contribution of steady-state pressures (mean arterial pressure 
      [MAP]), Pf and Pb, to cardiovascular damage is organ specific and age dependent. 
      METHODS: In 1,384 black South Africans from a community sample, we identified 
      independent relations between MAP, Pf, or Pb (applanation tonometry and 
      SphygmoCor software) and left ventricular mass index (LVMI) (n = 997) 
      (echocardiography), carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) (n = 804) (B-mode 
      ultrasound), or aortic pulse wave velocity (PWV) (n = 1,217). RESULTS: 
      Independent of risk factors, relations between Pf and IMT were noted in those 
      over 50 years (P < 0.02), whereas in those less than 50 years, MAP (P < 0.005) 
      was independently associated with IMT. Pb failed to show independent relations 
      with IMT at any age (P > 0.37) In contrast, independent relations between Pb and 
      LVMI were noted in those less than (P < 0.0001), and greater than (P < 0.02) 50 
      years, whereas MAP was not independently associated with LVMI at any age (P > 
      0.07) and Pf tended to show significant relations only in the elderly (P = 0.05). 
      Moreover, although MAP (P < 0.005) and Pb (P < 0.01) showed independent relations 
      with PWV at any age, Pf failed to show independent relations (P > 0.10). 
      CONCLUSION: Independent of confounders, steady-state and aortic Pf and Pb show 
      associations with end-organ measures that are organ specific and age dependent.

      Population.
PG  - 606-613
LID - 10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.119.13255 [doi]
AB  - Arterial stiffness and wave reflection predict cardiovascular mortality and 
      morbidity and are associated with renal microvascular disease. We hypothesized 
      that the retinal microvascular traits might be associated with central 
      hemodynamic properties. In 735 randomly recruited Flemish (mean age, 50.3 years; 
      47.1% women), we derived central pulse pressure and carotid-femoral pulse wave 
      velocity by applanation tonometry and calculated forward (Pf) and backward (Pb) 
      pulse waves, using an automated pressure-based wave separation algorithm. We 
      measured central retinal arteriolar (CRAE) and venular equivalent and their 
      ratio, using IVAN software (Vasculomatic ala Nicola, version 1.1). Mean values 
      for pulse wave velocity (n=554), Pf and Pb were 7.50 m/s, 32.0 mm Hg, and 21.5 
      mm Hg, respectively. In multivariable-adjusted analyses, CRAE was 4.62 µm and 
      1.26 µm smaller (P≤0.034) for a 1-SD increment in central mean arterial pressure 
      (+11.3 mm Hg) and central pulse pressure (+15.2 mm Hg); a 1-SD increment in the 
      augmentation ratio (+7.0%), aortic pulse wave velocity (+1.66 m/s), Pf (+10.0 
      mm Hg), and Pb (+8.5 mm Hg), was associated with smaller CRAE; the association 
      sizes were -1.91 µm, -1.59 µm, -1.45 µm, and -2.38 µm (P≤0.014), respectively. 
      Associations of arteriole-to-venule diameter ratio with the central hemodynamic 
      traits mirrored those of CRAE. None of the multivariable-adjusted associations of 
      central retinal venular diameter with the central hemodynamic traits reached 
      significance with the exception of central diastolic blood pressure (-1.62 µm; 
      P=0.030). In conclusion, in the general population, higher central pulse 
      pressure, pulse wave velocity, Pf, and Pb were associated with smaller CRAE.

TI  - Increased Nighttime Pulse Pressure Variability but Not Ambulatory Blood Pressure 
      Levels Predicts 14-Year All-Cause Mortality in Patients on Hemodialysis.
PG  - 660-668

AB  - Increased short-term blood pressure (BP) variability is associated with adverse 
      cardiovascular outcomes in patients with hypertension. The present study 
      investigated the long-term prognostic significance of the short-term blood 
      pressure variability in patients on hemodialysis. A total of 149 patients (53.0% 
      male; mean age: 54.5±15.1 years) receiving regular hemodialysis for >6 months 
      were enrolled. They completed a 44-hour (excluding the hemodialysis session) 
      ambulatory BP monitoring and comprehensive hemodynamic assessments, including 
      carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity and pressure waveform decomposition (forward 
      and backward wave amplitude). Blood pressure variability parameters, including 
      average real variability (ARV) of systolic BP, diastolic BP, and pulse pressure 
      (ARVp) during daytime, nighttime, and overall 44 hours were calculated. During a 
      median follow-up of 14 years, 78 deaths (52.4%) were confirmed. In multivariable 
      Cox regression analysis, none of the ambulatory BP parameters were predictive of 
      mortality. In contrast, nighttime ARVp was consistently and significantly 
      associated with all-cause mortality in multivariable Cox models adjusting for 
      age, sex, albumin, hemodialysis treatment adequacy, and 44-hour systolic BP 
      (continuous variable analysis, per 1-SD, hazard ratio=1.348; 95% CI, 1.029-1.767; 
      categorical variable analysis, ≥8.5 versus <8.5 mm Hg; hazard ratio=1.825; 95% 
      CI, 1.074-3.103). Forward wave amplitude and 44-hour systolic BP were identified 
      as the 2 most important determinants of nighttime ARVp. Addition of nighttime 
      ARVp to the base model significantly improved prediction of all-cause mortality 
      (Net reclassification improvement =0.198; P=0.0012). In hemodialysis patients, 
      increased short-term nighttime pulse pressure variability but not ambulatory BP 
      levels were significantly predictive of long-term all-cause mortality.

TI  - Aortic pulse wave velocity and reflecting distance estimation from peripheral 
      waveforms in humans: detection of age- and exercise training-related differences.
PG  - H135-42
LID - 10.1152/ajpheart.00916.2012 [doi]
AB  - We hypothesized that demographic/anthropometric parameters can be used to 
      estimate effective reflecting distance (EfRD), required to derive aortic pulse 
      wave velocity (APWV), a prognostic marker of cardiovascular risk, from peripheral 
      waveforms and that such estimates can discriminate differences in APWV and EfRD 
      with aging and habitual endurance exercise in healthy adults. Ascending aortic 
      pressure waveforms were derived from peripheral waveforms (brachial artery 
      pressure, n = 25; and finger volume pulse, n = 15) via a transfer function and 
      then used to determine the time delay between forward- and backward-traveling 
      waves (Δtf-b). True EfRDs were computed as directly measured carotid-femoral 
      pulse wave velocity (CFPWV) × 1/2Δtf-b and then used in regression analysis to 
      establish an equation for EfRD based on demographic/anthropometric data (EfRD = 
      0.173·age + 0.661·BMI + 34.548 cm, where BMI is body mass index). We found good 
      agreement between true and estimated APWV (Pearson's R² = 0.43; intraclass 
      correlation = 0.64; both P < 0.05) and EfRD (R² = 0.24; intraclass correlation = 
      0.40; both P < 0.05). In young sedentary (22 ± 2 years, n = 6), older sedentary 
      (62 ± 1 years, n = 24), and older endurance-trained (61 ± 2 years, n = 14) 
      subjects, EfRD (from demographic/anthropometric parameters), APWV, and 1/2Δtf-b 
      (from brachial artery pressure waveforms) were 52.0 ± 0.5, 61.8 ± 0.4, and 60.6 ± 
      0.5 cm; 6.4 ± 0.3, 9.6 ± 0.2, and 8.1 ± 0.2 m/s; and 82 ± 3, 65 ± 1 and 76 ± 2 ms 
      (all P < 0.05), respectively. Our results demonstrate that APWV derived from 
      peripheral waveforms using age and BMI to estimate EfRD correlates with CFPWV in 
      healthy adults. This method can reliably detect the distal shift of the 
      reflecting site with age and the increase in APWV with sedentary aging that is 
      attenuated with habitual endurance exercise.

TI  - Estimation of Characteristic Impedance using Multi-Gaussian Modelled Flow 
      Velocity Waveform: A Virtual Subjects Study.
PG  - 2274-2277
LID - 10.1109/EMBC48229.2022.9871684 [doi]
AB  - Characteristic impedance (Zc) of the blood vessel relates the pulsatile pressure 
      to pulsatile blood flow velocity devoid of any wave reflections. Estimation of 
      Z(C) is useful for indirect evaluation of local pulse wave velocity and crucial 
      for solving wave separation analysis (WSA) which separates the forward-backward 
      pressure and flow velocity waveforms. As opposed to conventional WSA, which 
      requires simultaneous measurement of pressure and flow velocity waveform, 
      simplified WSA relies on modelled flow velocity waveforms, mainly introduced for 
      the aorta. This work uses a multi-Gaussian decomposition (MGD) modelled flow 
      velocity waveform to estimate Z(C) by employing a frequency domain analysis, 
      which is applicable to other arteries such as carotid. Thus obtained ZC is 
      compared with Zc estimated from true flow velocity waveform for healthy (virtual) 
      subjects taken for the carotid artery. The MGD modelled flow velocity waveform 
      estimated ZC for a range of 4.98 to 34.79 with a group average of 16.43±0.10. The 
      difference between the group average values of both ZC was only 4.72%. A 
      statistically significant and strong correlation (r = 0.708, p < 0.0001) was 
      observed for ZC obtained from MGD modelled flow velocity waveform with ZC 
      obtained from actual flow velocity waveform. The bias for ZC1 between the two 
      methods was 0.74, with confidence intervals (CIs) between 7.44 and -5.96 for the 
      Bland-Altman analysis. Therefore, ZC from MGD modelled flow velocity waveform is 
      a potential surrogate of the flow velocity model for WSA at the carotid artery. 
      Clinical Relevance- This study provides a new method to derive characteristic 
      impedance without the measurement of actual flow velocity waveform. The method 
      requires a single pulse waveform (pressure or diameter).

TI  - Insulin stimulation reduces aortic wave reflection in adults with metabolic 
      syndrome.
PG  - H2305-H2312
LID - 10.1152/ajpheart.00975.2020 [doi]
AB  - Adults with metabolic syndrome (MetS) have increased fasting arterial stiffness 
      and altered central hemodynamics that contribute, partly, to increased 
      cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. Although insulin affects aortic wave 
      reflections in healthy adults, the effects in individuals with MetS are unclear. 
      We hypothesized that insulin stimulation would reduce measures of pressure 
      waveforms and hemodynamics in people with MetS. Thirty-five adults with obesity 
      (27 women; 54.2 ± 6.0 yr; 37.1 ± 4.8 kg/m(2)) were selected for MetS (ATP III 
      criteria) following an overnight fast. Pulse wave analysis was assessed using 
      applanation tonometry before and after a 2-h euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp 
      (90 mg/dL, 40 mU/m(2)/min). Deconvolution analysis was used to decompose the 
      aortic waveform [augmentation index corrected to heart rate of 75 beats/min 
      (AIx@75); augmentation pressure (AP)] into backward and forward pressure 
      components. Aerobic fitness (V̇o(2max)), body composition (DXA), and blood 
      biochemistries were also assessed. Insulin significantly reduced augmentation 
      index (AIx@75, 28.0 ± 9.6 vs. 23.0 ± 9.9%, P < 0.01), augmentation pressure 
      (14.8 ± 6.4 vs. 12.0 ± 5.7 mmHg, P < 0.01), pulse pressure amplification 
      (1.26 ± 0.01 vs. 0.03 ± 0.01, P = 0.01), and inflammation [high-sensitivity 
      C-reactive protein (hsCRP): P = 0.02; matrix metallopeptidase 7 (MMP-7): P = 
      0.03] compared to fasting. In subgroup analyses to understand HTN influence, 
      there were no insulin stimulation differences on any outcome. V̇o(2max), visceral 
      fat, and blood potassium correlated with fasting AIx@75 (r = -0.39, P = 0.02; 
      r = 0.41, P = 0.03; r = -0.53, P = 0.002). Potassium levels were also associated 
      with insulin-mediated reductions in AP (r = 0.52, P = 0.002). Our results suggest 
      insulin stimulation improves indices of aortic reflection in adults with MetS.NEW 
      & NOTEWORTHY This study is one of the first to investigate the effects of insulin 
      on central and peripheral hemodynamics in adults with metabolic syndrome. We 
      provide evidence that insulin infusion reduces aortic wave reflection, 
      potentially through a reduction in inflammation and/or via a potassium-mediated 
      vascular response.

TI  - Prognostic Value of Carotid and Radial Artery Reservoir-Wave Parameters in 
      End-Stage Renal Disease.

AB  - Background Reservoir-wave approach is an alternative model of arterial 
      hemodynamics based on the assumption that measured arterial pressure is composed 
      of volume-related (reservoir pressure) and wave-related components (excess 
      pressure). However, the clinical utility of reservoir-wave approach remains 
      debatable. Methods and Results In a single-center cohort of 260 dialysis 
      patients, we examined whether carotid and radial reservoir-wave parameters were 
      associated with all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. Central pulse pressure 
      and augmentation index at 75 beats per minute were determined by radial arterial 
      tonometry through generalized transfer function. Carotid and radial 
      reservoir-wave analysis were performed to determine reservoir pressure and excess 
      pressure integral. After a median follow-up of 32 months, 171 (66%) deaths and 88 
      (34%) cardiovascular deaths occurred. In Cox regression analysis, carotid excess 
      pressure integral was associated with a hazard ratio of 1.33 (95% CI , 1.14-1.54; 
      P<0.001 per 1 SD) for all-cause and 1.45 (95% CI : 1.18-1.75; P<0.001 per 1 SD) 
      for cardiovascular mortality. After adjustments for age, heart rate, sex, 
      clinical characteristics and carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity, carotid excess 
      pressure integral was consistently associated with increased risk of all-cause 
      (hazard ratio per 1 SD, 1.30; 95% CI : 1.08-1.54; P=0.004) and cardiovascular 
      mortality (hazard ratio per 1 SD, 1.31; 95% CI : 1.04-1.63; P=0.019). Conversely, 
      there were no significant associations between radial reservoir-wave parameters, 
      central pulse pressure, augmentation index at 75 beats per minute, pressure 
      forward, pressure backward and reflection magnitude, and all-cause or 
      cardiovascular mortality after adjustment for comorbidities. Conclusions These 
      observations support the clinical value of reservoir-wave approach parameters of 
      large central elastic vessels in end-stage renal disease.

TI  - Mathematical modelling of cardiac pulse wave reflections due to arterial 
      irregularities.
PG  - 1055-1076
LID - 10.3934/mbe.2018047 [doi]
AB  - This research aims to model cardiac pulse wave reflections due to the presence of 
      arterial irregularities such as bifurcations, stiff arteries, stenoses or 
      aneurysms. When an arterial pressure wave encounters an irregularity, a backward 
      reflected wave travels upstream in the artery and a forward wave is transmitted 
      downstream. The same process occurs at each subsequent irregularity, leading to 
      the generation of multiple waves. An iterative algorithm is developed and applied 
      to pathological scenarios to predict the pressure waveform of the reflected wave 
      due to the presence of successive arterial irregularities. For an isolated 
      stenosis, analysing the reflected pressure waveform gives information on its 
      severity. The presence of a bifurcation after a stenosis tends do diminish the 
      amplitude of the reflected wave, as bifurcations' reflection coefficients are 
      relatively small compared to the ones of stenoses or aneurysms. In the case of 
      two stenoses in series, local extrema are observed in the reflected pressure 
      waveform which appears to be a characteristic of stenoses in series along an 
      individual artery. Finally, we model a progressive change in stiffness in the 
      vessel's wall and observe that the less the gradient stiffness is important, the 
      weaker is the reflected wave.

TI  - Acute effects of transcatheter aortic valve replacement on the ventricular-aortic 
      interaction.
PG  - H1451-H1458
LID - 10.1152/ajpheart.00451.2020 [doi]
AB  - Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is increasingly used to treat 
      severe aortic stenosis (AS) patients. However, little is known regarding the 
      direct effect of TAVR on the ventricular-aortic interaction. In the present 
      study, we aimed to investigate changes in central hemodynamics after successful 
      TAVR. We retrospectively examined 33 cases of severe AS patients (84 ± 6 yr) who 
      underwent TAVR. Invasive measurements of left ventricular and aortic pressures as 
      well as echocardiographic aortic flow were acquired before and after TAVR 
      (maximum within 5 days). We examined alterations in key features of central 
      pressure and flow waveforms, including the aortic augmentation index (AIx), and 
      performed wave separation analysis. Arterial parameters were determined via 
      parameter-fitting on a two-element Windkessel model. Resolution of AS resulted in 
      direct increase in the aortic systolic pressure and maximal aortic flow (131 ± 22 
      vs. 157 ± 25 mmHg and 237 ± 49 vs. 302 ± 69 mL/s, P < 0.001 for all), whereas the 
      ejection duration decreased (P < 0.001). We noted a significant decrease in the 
      AIx (from 42 ± 12 to 19 ± 11%, P < 0.001). Of note, the arterial properties 
      remained unchanged. There was a comparable increase in both forward (61 ± 20 vs. 
      77 ± 20 mmHg, P < 0.001) and backward (35 ± 14 vs. 42 ± 10 mmHg, P = 0.013) 
      pressure wave amplitudes, while their ratio, i.e., the reflection coefficient, 
      was preserved. Our results highlight the impact of TAVR on the ventricular-aortic 
      interaction by affecting the amplitude, shape, and related attributes of the 
      aortic pressure and flow pulse and challenge the interpretation of AIx as a 
      solely vascular measure in AS patients.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Transcatheter aortic 
      valve replacement (TAVR) is linked with an immediate increase in aortic systolic 
      blood pressure and maximal flow, as well as steeper aortic pressure and flow wave 
      upstrokes. After TAVR, the forward wave pumped by the heart is enhanced. Although 
      the arterial properties remain unchanged, the central augmentation index (AIx) is 
      markedly decreased after TAVR. This challenges the interpretation of AIx as a 
      solely vascular measure in patients with aortic valve stenosis.

TI  - Post-exercise effects on aortic wave reflection derived from wave separation 
      analysis in young- to middle-aged pre-hypertensives and hypertensives.
PG  - 1321-9
LID - 10.1007/s00421-016-3391-1 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Decreases in brachial blood pressure (BP) may occur for several hours 
      following a bout of exercise. Although aortic backward waves predict 
      cardiovascular damage independent of brachial BP, whether decreases in aortic 
      backward waves also occur post-exercise in young-to-middle-aged hypertensives, 
      the extent to which these changes exceed brachial BP changes, and the best method 
      of identifying these changes is uncertain. METHODS: We examined aortic function 
      at baseline and 15-min post-exercise in 20 pre-hypertensive or hypertensive men 
      and women (age 45 ± 7 years). Central aortic pressure, forward (Pf) and backward 
      (Pb) wave pressures, the reflection index (RI) and augmentation pressure (AP) and 
      index (AIx) were determined using applanation tonometry, and SphygmoCor software. 
      RESULTS: Decreases in central aortic (p < 0.001) but not brachial systolic BP and 
      pulse pressure (PP) occurred post-exercise. In addition, decreases in 
      post-exercise (baseline versus post-exercise) Pb (19 ± 4 vs 13 ± 3 mm Hg 
      p < 0.0001), RI (72.9 ± 22.1 vs 47.6 ± 12.8 %, p < 0.0001), AIx (26.3 ± 10.8 vs 
      7.8 ± 11.6 %, p < 0.0001) and AP (9.9 ± 3.9 vs 2.8 ± 3.9 mm Hg, p < 0.0001), but 
      not Pf, were noted. However, decreases in AIx were not correlated with decreases 
      in Pb, and whilst decreases in aortic PP correlated with decreases in Pb 
      (p < 0.0001), no correlations were noted with decreases in AP or AIx. CONCLUSION: 
      In young-to-middle-aged pre-hypertensive and hypertensive individuals, aortic 
      backward waves decrease post-exercise; this change is not reflected in brachial 
      BP measurements and is poorly indexed by measures of pressure augmentation.

TI  - A computational study of pressure wave reflections in the pulmonary arteries.
PG  - 1525-49
LID - 10.1007/s00285-015-0867-2 [doi]
AB  - Experiments using wave intensity analysis suggest that the pulmonary circulation 
      in sheep and dogs is characterized by negative or open-end type wave reflections, 
      that reduce the systolic pressure. Since the pulmonary physiology is similar in 
      most mammals, including humans, we test and verify this hypothesis by using a 
      subject specific one-dimensional model of the human pulmonary circulation and a 
      conventional wave intensity analysis. Using the simulated pressure and velocity, 
      we also analyse the performance of the P-U loop and sum of squares techniques for 
      estimating the local pulse wave velocity in the pulmonary arteries, and then 
      analyse the effects of these methods on linear wave separation in the main 
      pulmonary artery. P-U loops are found to provide much better estimates than the 
      sum of squares technique at proximal locations, but both techniques accumulate 
      progressive error at distal locations away from heart, particularly near 
      junctions. The pulse wave velocity estimated using the sum of squares method also 
      gives rise to an artificial early systolic backward compression wave. Finally, we 
      study the influence of three types of pulmonary hypertension viz. pulmonary 
      arterial hypertension, chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension and 
      pulmonary hypertension associated with hypoxic lung disease. Simulating these 
      conditions by changing the relevant parameters in the model and then applying the 
      wave intensity analysis, we observe that for each group the early systolic 
      backward decompression wave reflected from proximal junctions is maintained, 
      whilst the initial forward compression and the late systolic backward compression 
      waves amplify with increasing pathology and contribute significantly to increases 
      in systolic pressure.

TI  - Central Hemodynamics in Relation to Circulating Desphospho-Uncarboxylated Matrix 
      Gla Protein: A Population Study.

AB  - Background Stiffening and calcification of the large arteries are forerunners of 
      cardiovascular complications. MGP (Matrix Gla protein), which requires vitamin 
      K-dependent activation, is a potent locally acting inhibitor of arterial 
      calcification. We hypothesized that the central hemodynamic properties might be 
      associated with inactive desphospho-uncarboxylated MGP (dp-uc MGP ). Methods and 
      Results In 835 randomly recruited Flemish individuals (mean age, 49.7 years; 
      45.6% women), we measured plasma dp-uc MGP , using an ELISA -based assay. We 
      derived central pulse pressure and carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV) from 
      applanation tonometry and calculated forward and backward pulse waves using an 
      automated, pressure-based wave separation analysis algorithm. Aortic PWV (n=657), 
      central pulse pressure, forward pulse wave, and backward pulse wave mean± SD 
      values were 7.34±1.64 m/s, 45.2±15.3 mm Hg, 33.2±10.2 mm Hg, and 21.8±8.6 mm Hg, 
      respectively. The geometric mean plasma concentration of dp-uc MGP was 4.09 μg/L. 
      All hemodynamic indexes increased across tertiles of dp-uc MGP distribution. In 
      multivariable-adjusted analyses, a doubling of dp-uc MGP was associated with 
      higher PWV (0.15 m/s; 95% CI, 0.01-0.28 m/s), central pulse pressure (1.70 mm Hg; 
      95% CI, 0.49-2.91 mm Hg), forward pulse wave (0.93 mm Hg; 95% CI, 0.01-1.84 mm 
      Hg), and backward pulse wave (0.71 mm Hg; 95% CI, 0.11-1.30 mm Hg). 
      Categorization of aortic PWV by tertiles of its distribution highlighted a 
      decreasing trend of PWV at low dp-uc MGP (<3.35 μg/L) and an increasing trend at 
      high dp-uc MGP (≥5.31 μg/L). Conclusions In people representative for the general 
      population, higher inactive dp-uc MGP was associated with greater PWV , central 
      pulse pressure, forward pulse wave, and backward pulse wave. These observations 
      highlight new avenues for preserving vascular integrity and preventing 
      cardiovascular complications (eg, by improving a person's vitamin K status).

TI  - Personalized physiologic flow waveforms improve wave reflection estimates 
      compared to triangular flow waveforms in adults.
PG  - H1802-H1812
LID - 10.1152/ajpheart.00747.2020 [doi]
AB  - Central aortic pressure waveforms contain valuable prognostic information in 
      addition to central systolic pressure. Using pressure-flow relations, wave 
      separation analysis can be used to decompose aortic pressure waveforms into 
      forward- (Pf) and backward-traveling (Pb) components. Reflection magnitude, the 
      ratio of pressure amplitudes (RM = Pb/Pf), is a predictor of heart failure and 
      all-cause mortality. Aortic flow can be measured via Doppler echocardiography or 
      estimated using a triangular flow waveform; however, the latter may underestimate 
      the flow waveform convexity and overestimate Pb and RM. We sought to determine 
      the accuracy of a personalized synthetic physiologic flow waveform, compared with 
      triangular and measured flow waveforms, for estimating wave reflection indices in 
      49 healthy young (27 ± 6 yr) and 29 older adults [66 ± 6 yr; 20 healthy, 9 
      chronic kidney disease (CKD)]. Aortic pressure and measured flow waveforms were 
      acquired via radial tonometry and echocardiography, respectively. Triangular and 
      physiologic flow waveforms were constructed from aortic pressure waveforms. 
      Compared with the measured flow waveform, the triangular waveform underestimated 
      Pf in older, but not young, adults and overestimated Pb and RM in both groups. 
      The physiologic waveform was equivalent to measured flow in deriving all wave 
      reflection indices and yielded smaller mean absolute biases than the triangular 
      waveform in all instances (P < 0.05). Lastly, central pulse pressure was 
      associated with triangular, but not physiologic, mean biases for Pb and RM 
      independent of age or central arterial stiffness (P < 0.05). These findings 
      support the use of personalized physiologic flow waveforms as a more robust 
      alternative to triangular flow waveforms when true flow cannot be measured.NEW & 
      NOTEWORTHY We demonstrate that triangular flow waveforms overestimate wave 
      reflection indices, particularly at higher central pulse pressures independent of 
      age or carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity. In contrast, personalized physiologic 
      flow waveforms provide equivalent wave reflection estimates as measured flow 
      waveforms, thereby offering a more robust alternative to triangulation when 
      aortic flow cannot be measured.

AB  - The quantification of arterial wave reflection is an important area of interest 
      in arterial pulse wave analysis. It can be achieved by wave separation analysis 
      (WSA) if both the aortic pressure waveform and the aortic flow waveform are 
      known. For better applicability, several mathematical models have been 
      established to estimate aortic flow solely based on pressure waveforms. The aim 
      of this study is to investigate and verify the model-based wave separation of the 
      ARCSolver method on virtual pulse wave measurements. The study is based on an 
      open access virtual database generated via simulations. Seven cardiac and 
      arterial parameters were varied within physiological healthy ranges, leading to a 
      total of 3325 virtual healthy subjects. For assessing the model-based ARCSolver 
      method computationally, this method was used to perform WSA based on the aortic 
      root pressure waveforms of the virtual patients. Asa reference, the values of WSA 
      using both the pressure and flow waveforms provided by the virtual database were 
      taken. The investigated parameters showed a good overall agreement between the 
      model-based method and the reference. Mean differences and standard deviations 
      were -0.05±0.02AU for characteristic impedance, -3.93±1.79mmHg for forward 
      pressure amplitude, 1.37±1.56mmHg for backward pressure amplitude and 12.42±4.88% 
      for reflection magnitude. The results indicate that the mathematical blood flow 
      model of the ARCSolver method is a feasible surrogate for a measured flow 
      waveform and provides a reasonable way to assess arterial wave reflection 
      non-invasively in healthy subjects.

AB  - Arterial pulse waves contain clinically useful information about cardiac 
      performance, arterial stiffness and vessel tone. Here we describe a novel method 
      for non-invasively assessing wave properties, based on measuring changes in blood 
      flow velocity and arterial wall diameter during the cardiac cycle. Velocity and 
      diameter were determined by tracking speckles in successive B-mode images 
      acquired with an ultrafast scanner and plane-wave transmission. Blood speckle was 
      separated from tissue by singular value decomposition and processed to correct 
      biases in ultrasound imaging velocimetry. Results obtained in the rabbit aorta 
      were compared with a conventional analysis based on blood velocity and pressure, 
      employing measurements obtained with a clinical intra-arterial catheter system. 
      This system had a poorer frequency response and greater lags but the pattern of 
      net forward-traveling and backward-traveling waves was consistent between the two 
      methods. Errors in wave speed were also similar in magnitude, and comparable 
      reductions in wave intensity and delays in wave arrival were detected during 
      ventricular dysfunction. The non-invasive method was applied to the carotid 
      artery of a healthy human participant and gave a wave speed and patterns of wave 
      intensity consistent with earlier measurements. The new system may have clinical 
      utility in screening for heart failure.

AB  - Background: Aortic pulse wave velocity (aPWV) predicts cardiovascular 
      complications, but the association of central arterial properties with blood lead 
      level (BL) is poorly documented. We therefore assessed their association with BL 
      in 150 young men prior to occupational lead exposure, using baseline data of the 
      Study for Promotion of Health in Recycling Lead (NCT02243904). Methods: Study 
      nurses administered validated questionnaires and performed clinical measurements. 
      Venous blood samples were obtained after 8-12 h of fasting. The radial, carotid 
      and femoral pulse waves were tonometrically recorded. We accounted for ethnicity, 
      age, anthropometric characteristics, mean arterial pressure, heart rate, smoking 
      and drinking, and total and high-density lipoprotein serum cholesterol, as 
      appropriate. Results: Mean values were 4.14 μg/dL for BL, 27 years for age, 
      108/79/28 mm Hg for central systolic/diastolic/pulse pressure, 100/10% for the 
      augmentation ratio/index, 1.63 for pressure amplification, 5.94 m/s for aPWV, 
      27/11 mm Hg for the forward/backward pulse pressure height, and 43% for the 
      reflection index. Per 10-fold BL increase, central diastolic pressure and the 
      augmentation ratio were respectively 5.37 mm Hg (95% confidence interval [CI], 
      1.00-9.75) and 1.57 (CI, 0.20-2.94) greater, whereas central pulse pressure and 
      the forward pulse pressure height were 3.74 mm Hg (CI, 0.60-6.88) and 3.37 mm Hg 
      (CI, 0.22-6.53) smaller (p ≤ .036 for all). The other hemodynamic measurements 
      were unrelated to BL. The reflected pulse peak time was inversely correlated with 
      diastolic pressure (r = -0.20; p ≤ .017). Conclusion: At the exposure levels 
      observed in our current study, aPWV, the gold standard to assess arterial 
      stiffness, was not associated with BL. Increased peripheral arterial resistance, 
      as reflected by higher diastolic pressure, might bring reflection points closer 
      to the heart, thereby moving the backward wave into systole and increasing the 
      augmentation ratio in relation to BL.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the wave reflection characteristics in the aortic arch and 
      common carotid artery of ex-preterm adolescents and assess their relationship to 
      central blood pressure in a cohort followed prospectively since birth. METHODS: 
      Central blood pressures, pulse wave velocity, augmentation index, microvascular 
      reactive hyperemia, arterial distensibility, compliance and stiffness index, and 
      also aortic and carotid wave intensity were measured in 18-year-olds born 
      extremely preterm at below 28 weeks' gestation (n = 76) and term-born controls 
      (n = 42). RESULTS: Compared with controls, ex-preterm adolescents had higher 
      central systolic (111 ± 11 vs. 105 ± 10 mmHg; P < 0.001) and diastolic blood 
      pressures (73 ± 7 vs. 67 ± 7 mmHg; P < 0.001). Although conventional measures of 
      arterial function and biomechanics such as pulse wave velocity and augmentation 
      index were no different between groups, wave intensity analysis revealed elevated 
      backward compression wave area (-0.39 ± 0.21 vs. -0.29 ± 0.17 W/m/s × 10; 
      P = 0.03), backward compression wave pressure change (9.0 ± 3.5 vs. 
      6.6 ± 2.5 mmHg; P = 0.001) and reflection index (0.44 ± 0.15 vs. 0.32 ± 0.08; 
      P < 0.001) in the aorta of ex-preterm adolescents compared with controls. These 
      changes were less pronounced in the carotid artery. On multivariable analysis, 
      forward and backward compression wave areas were the only biomechanical variables 
      associated with central systolic pressure. CONCLUSIONS: Ex-preterm adolescents 
      demonstrate elevated wave reflection indices in the aortic arch, which correlate 
      with central systolic pressure. Wave intensity analysis may provide a sensitive 
      novel marker of evolving vascular dysfunction in ex-preterm survivors.

      ageing effects in healthy humans.
PG  - 347-355
LID - 10.1097/HJH.0000000000001886 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of age and sex on 
      nPWV and ndI in the ascending aorta of healthy humans. BACKGROUND: Local pulse 
      wave velocity (nPWV) and wave intensity (ndI) in the human ascending aorta have 
      not been studied adequately, because of the need for invasive pressure 
      measurements. However, a recently developed technique made the noninvasive 
      determination of nPWV and ndI possible using measurements of flow velocity and 
      arterial diameter. METHODS: Diameter and flow velocity were measured at the level 
      of the ascending aorta in 144 healthy participants (aged 20-77 years, 66 men), 
      using MRI. nPWV, ndI parameters; forward (FCW); backward (BCW) compression waves, 
      forward decompression wave (FDW), local aortic distensibility (nDs) and 
      reflection index (nRI) were calculated. RESULTS: nPWV increased significantly 
      with age from 4.7 ± 0.3 m/s for those 20-30 years to 6.4 ± 0.2 m/s for those 
      70-80 years (P < 0.001) and did not differ between sexes. nDs decreased with age 
      (5.3 ± 0.5 vs. 2.6 ± 0.2 10 1/Pa, P < 0.001) and nRI increased with age 
      (0.17 ± 0.03 vs. 0.39 ± 0.06, P < 0.01) for those 20-30 and 70-80 years, 
      respectively. FCW, BCW and FDW decreased significantly with age by 86.3, 71.3 and 
      74.2%, respectively (P < 0.001), all compared to the lowest age-band. CONCLUSION: 
      In healthy humans, ageing results in stiffer ascending aorta, with increase in 
      nPWV and decrease in nDs. A decrease in FCW and FDW indicates decline in left 
      ventricular early and late systolic functions with age in healthy humans with no 
      differences between sexes. nRI is more sensitive than BCW in establishing the 
      effects of ageing on reflected waves measured in the ascending aorta.

      arterial tonometry.
PG  - 1609-1617
LID - 10.1097/HJH.0000000000001366 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Aortic stiffness and central pressure measurements have become 
      increasingly important for the overall estimation of cardiovascular risk. The aim 
      of this study is to verify whether the presence of stenosis in the carotid 
      arteries due to atherosclerotic plaques may induce a bias in the measurement of 
      carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV) and in the analysis of central pulse 
      waveform variables assessed by carotid tonometry. METHODS: Eighty-four patients 
      (age: 67.1 ± 12.4 years) undergoing screening for carotid atherosclerosis were 
      enrolled, divided into three groups according to carotid ultrasound findings 
      (NASCET criteria): 28 patients without significant stenosis, 30 patients with 
      bilateral plaques, and 26 patients with right or left monolateral stenosis. PWV 
      and other variables derived from the central pulse waveform analysis (central 
      blood pressure, augmentation index and forward and backward waves) were measured 
      at both right and left carotid arteries by a validated PulsePen tonometer. A 
      repeatability study was performed in 28 young healthy patients (age: 25.4 ± 2.9 
      years). RESULTS: A high degree of correlation was found between bilateral 
      measurements in all groups, and particularly in groups with monolateral carotid 
      stenosis, with no significant difference attributable to lateralized stenosis. 
      Right-left differences in asymmetric groups were 0.35 ± 5.12 mmHg (R = 0.960) for 
      central blood pressure, -2.12 ± 7.39% (R = 0.743) for augmentation index, 
      0.64 ± 1.56 m/s (R = 0.947) for PWV, 0.08 ± 8.48 mmHg for forward wave 
      (R = 0.742) and 0.35 ± 2.35 mmHg for backward wave (R = 0.907). CONCLUSION: 
      Measurement of PWV and of variables derived from the central pulse waveform 
      analysis by carotid tonometry is not biased by the presence of local 
      atherosclerotic plaques.

TI  - Noninvasive wave intensity analysis predicts functional worsening in children 
      with pulmonary arterial hypertension.
PG  - H968-H977
LID - 10.1152/ajpheart.00227.2018 [doi]
AB  - The purpose of the present study was to characterize pulmonary vascular stiffness 
      using wave intensity analysis (WIA) in children with pulmonary arterial 
      hypertension (PAH), compare the WIA indexes with catheterization- and MRI-derived 
      hemodynamics, and assess the prognostic ability of WIA-derived biomarkers to 
      predict the functional worsening. WIA was performed in children with PAH ( n = 
      40) and healthy control subjects ( n = 15) from phase-contrast MRI-derived flow 
      and area waveforms in the main pulmonary artery (MPA). From comprehensive WIA 
      spectra, we collected and compared with healthy control subjects forward 
      compression waves (FCW), backward compression waves (BCW), forward decompression 
      waves (FDW), and wave propagation speed ( c-MPA). There was no difference in the 
      magnitude of FCW between PAH and control groups (88 vs. 108 mm(5)·s(-1)·ml(-1), P 
      = 0.239). The magnitude of BCW was increased in patients with PAH (32 vs. 5 
      mm(5)·s(-1)·ml(-1), P < 0.001). There was no difference in magnitude of indexed 
      FDW (32 vs. 28 mm(5)·s(-1)·ml(-1), P = 0.856). c-MPA was increased in patients 
      with PAH (3.2 vs. 1.6 m/s, P < 0.001). BCW and FCW correlated with mean pulmonary 
      arterial pressure, right ventricular volumes, and ejection fraction. Elevated 
      indexed BCW [heart rate (HR) = 2.91, confidence interval (CI): 1.18-7.55, P = 
      0.019], reduced indexed FDW (HR = 0.34, CI: 0.11-0.90, P = 0.030), and increased 
      c-MPA (HR = 3.67, CI: 1.47-10.20, P = 0.004) were strongly associated with 
      functional worsening of disease severity. Our results suggest that noninvasively 
      derived biomarkers of pulmonary vascular resistance and stiffness may be helpful 
      for determining prognosis and monitoring disease progression in children with 
      PAH. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Wave intensity analysis (WIA) studies are lacking in 
      children with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) partially because WIA, which 
      is necessary to assess vascular stiffness, requires an invasive pressure-derived 
      waveform along with simultaneous flow measurements. We analyzed vascular

AB  - One-dimensional (1D) modeling is a powerful tool for studying haemodynamics; 
      however, a comprehensive 1D model representing the entire cardiovascular system 
      is lacking. We present a model that accounts for wave propagation in anatomically 
      realistic systemic (including coronary and cerebral) arterial/venous networks, 
      pulmonary arterial/venous networks and portal veins. A lumped parameter (0D) 
      heart model represents cardiac function via a time-varying elastance and source 
      resistance, and accounts for mechanical interactions between heart chambers 
      mediated via pericardial constraint, the atrioventricular septum and 
      atrioventricular plane motion. A non-linear windkessel-like 0D model represents 
      microvascular beds, while specialized 0D models are employed for the hepatic and 
      coronary beds. Model-derived pressure and flow waveforms throughout the 
      circulation are shown to reproduce the characteristic features of published human 
      waveforms. Moreover, wave intensity profiles closely resemble available in vivo 
      profiles. Forward and backward wave intensity is quantified and compared along 
      major arteriovenous paths, providing insights into wave dynamics in all of the 
      major physiological networks. Interactions between cardiac function/mechanics and 
      vascular waves are investigated. The model will be an important resource for 
      studying the mechanics underlying pressure/flow waveforms throughout the 
      circulation, along with global interactions between the heart and vessels under 
      normal and pathological conditions.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Increasing arterial stiffness is a feature of vascular aging that 
      is accelerated by conditions that enhance cardiovascular risk, including diabetes 
      mellitus. Multiple studies demonstrate divergence of carotid-femoral pulse wave 
      velocity and augmentation index in persons with diabetes mellitus, though 
      mechanisms responsible for this are unclear. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We tested the 
      effect of acutely and independently increasing plasma glucose, plasma insulin, or 
      both on hemodynamic function and markers of arterial stiffness (including 
      carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity, augmentation index, forward and backward 
      wave reflection amplitude, and wave reflection magnitude) in a four-arm, 
      randomized study of healthy young adults. RESULTS: Carotid-femoral pulse wave 
      velocity increased only during hyperglycemic-hyperinsulinemia (+0.36 m/s; 
      p = 0.032), while other markers of arterial stiffness did not change (all 
      p > 0.05). Heart rate (+3.62 bpm; p = 0.009), mean arterial pressure (+4.14 mmHg; 
      p = 0.033), central diastolic blood pressure (+4.16 mmHg; p = 0.038), and 
      peripheral diastolic blood pressure (+4.09 mmHg; p = 0.044) also significantly 
      increased during hyperglycemic-hyperinsulinemia. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Hyperglycemic-hyperinsulinemia acutely increased cfPWV, heart rate, mean arterial 
      pressure, and diastolic blood pressure in healthy humans, perhaps reflecting 
      enhanced sympathetic tone. Whether repeated bouts of hyperglycemia with 
      hyperinsulinemia contribute to chronically-enhanced arterial stiffness remains 
      unknown.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Wave reflection may be an important influence on blood pressure, but 
      the extent to which reflections undergo attenuation during retrograde propagation 
      has not been studied. We quantified retrograde transmission of a reflected wave 
      created by occlusion of the left femoral artery in man. METHODS: 20 subjects (age 
      31-83 years; 14 male) underwent invasive measurement of pressure and flow 
      velocity with a sensor-tipped intra-arterial wire at multiple locations distal to 
      the proximal aorta before, during and following occlusion of the left femoral 
      artery by thigh cuff inflation. A numerical model of the circulation was also 
      used to predict reflected wave transmission. Wave reflection was measured as the 
      ratio of backward to forward wave energy (WRI) and the ratio of peak backward to 
      forward pressure (Pb/Pf). RESULTS: Cuff inflation caused a marked reflection 
      which was largest at 5-10 cm from the cuff (change (Δ) in WRI=0.50 (95% CI 0.38, 
      0.62); p<0.001, ΔPb/Pf=0.23 (0.18-0.29); p<0.001). The magnitude of the 
      cuff-induced reflection decreased progressively at more proximal locations and 
      was barely discernible at sites>40 cm from the cuff including in the proximal 
      aorta. Numerical modelling gave similar predictions to those observed 
      experimentally. CONCLUSIONS: Reflections due to femoral artery occlusion are 
      markedly attenuated by the time they reach the proximal aorta. This is due to 
      impedance mismatches of bifurcations traversed in the backward direction. This 
      degree of attenuation is inconsistent with the idea of a large discrete reflected 
      wave arising from the lower limb and propagating back into the aorta.

TI  - Cardiac and haemodynamic influence on carotid artery longitudinal wall motion.
PG  - 141-152
LID - 10.1113/EP086621 [doi]
AB  - What is the central question of this study? Carotid artery longitudinal wall 
      motion (CALM) is a bidirectional forward and backward motion of the arterial 
      wall; however, there is no evidence in humans for what controls CALM despite 
      proposals for pulse pressure, left ventricular motion and shear rate. What is the 
      main finding and its importance? Carotid artery longitudinal wall motion 
      responses were heterogeneous when manipulating sympathetic activation and 
      endothelium-independent vasodilatation, leading to non-significant group 
      responses. However, individual CALM responses were associated with left 
      ventricular rotation and shear rate. These findings are important when 
      interpreting changes in CALM in humans with acute or chronic experimental 
      designs. Carotid artery longitudinal wall motion (CALM) has recently attracted 
      interest as an indicator of arterial health; however, the regulation of CALM is 
      poorly understood. We conducted a series of studies aimed at manipulating pulse 
      pressure (PP), left ventricular (LV) motion and carotid shear rate, which have 
      been previously suggested to regulate various components of CALM pattern and 
      magnitude. To determine the regulatory influences on CALM, 15 healthy men 
      (22 ± 2 years old) were exposed to three acute interventions: the serial 
      subtraction test (SST); the cold pressor test (CPT); and exposure to sublingual 
      nitroglycerine (NTG). The SST elicited increases in PP (P < 0.01), apical LV 
      rotation (P < 0.01) and carotid shear rate (P < 0.01), with no changes in CALM 
      (P > 0.05). Likewise, the CPT elicited increases in PP (P = 0.01), basal LV 
      rotation (P = 0.04) and carotid shear rate (P = 0.01), with no changes in CALM 
      (P > 0.05). Conversely, exposure to NTG elicited no change in PP (P = 0.22), 
      basal (P = 0.65) or apical LV rotation (P = 0.45), but did decrease carotid shear 
      rate (P < 0.01), without altering CALM (P > 0.05). Considerable individual 
      variability in CALM responses prompted further analyses where all three 
      interventions were pooled for change scores. Changes in LV basal rotation were 
      related to changes in systolic retrograde CALM (B = -0.025, P = 0.03), whereas 
      changes in carotid shear rate were related to changes in diastolic CALM 
      displacement (B = 0.0009, P = 0.01). The interventions were underpinned by 
      relationships between CALM and both LV basal rotation and local shear rate at the 
      individual level, indicating that cardiac and haemodynamic factors may influence 
      CALM in humans.

TI  - Hemodynamic Determinants of the Short-Term Blood Pressure Variability: 
      Differential Roles of Arterial Stiffness and Wave Reflection.
PG  - 256-263
LID - 10.1093/ajh/hpw144 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A high 24-hour ambulatory diastolic (DBP) but not systolic (SBP) 
      blood pressure variability (BPV) is significantly predictive of long-term 
      cardiovascular mortality in untreated hypertensive subjects, independent of 
      office or 24-hour SBP. The present study was aimed to investigate hemodynamic 
      factors that are independently associated with systolic and diastolic BPV from 
      the 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM). METHODS: A cohort of 624 
      normotensive and 633 untreated hypertensive participants with baseline ABPM was 
      drawn from a community-based survey. BPV was assessed by the read-to-read average 
      real variability of the 24-hour SBP and DBP (ARVs and ARVd, respectively). 
      Hemodynamic variables including total peripheral resistance (TPR), 
      carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (cf-PWV), and amplitudes of the decomposed 
      forward (Pf) and backward (Pb) carotid pressure waves were analyzed. RESULTS: In 
      multivariable analyses, hemodynamic variables independently associated with 
      24-hour SBP were 24-hour heart rate (HR), TPR, cf-PWV, Pf, and Pb (model r2 = 
      0.535). Hemodynamic factors independently associated with ARV were 24-hour HR, 
      Pf, and Pb for ARVs, and 24-hour HR, cf-PWV, Pf, and Pb for ARVd (model R2 = 
      0.345 and 0.220, respectively). Addition of 24-hour SBP to the ARV models only 
      slightly improved variance explained by the models (R2 = 0.383 and 0.224, 
      respectively). Pb accounted for >50% of total variance of ARVs and ARVd, whereas 
      cf-PWV was a minor determinant of ARVd (<5% of total variance). CONCLUSIONS: ARVd 
      was associated with fewer hemodynamic variables than to 24-hour SBP. Among those 
      hemodynamic variables wave reflection but not arterial stiffness had the dominant 
      independent association with ARV.

TI  - Acute Effects of Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement on Central Aortic 
      Hemodynamics in Patients With Severe Aortic Stenosis.
PG  - 1557-1564
LID - 10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.119.14385 [doi]
AB  - Severe aortic stenosis induces abnormalities in central aortic pressure, with 
      consequent impaired organ and tissue perfusion. Relief of aortic stenosis by 
      transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is associated with both a short- 
      and long-term hypertensive response. Counterintuitively, patients who are 
      long-term normotensive post-TAVR have a worsened prognosis compared with patients 
      with hypertension, yet the underlying mechanisms are not understood. We 
      investigated immediate changes in invasively measured left ventricular and 
      central aortic pressure post-TAVR in patients with severe aortic stenosis using 
      aortic reservoir pressure, wave intensity analysis, and indices of aortic 
      function. Fifty-four patients (mean age 83.6±6.2 years, 50.0% female) undergoing 
      TAVR were included. We performed reservoir pressure and wave intensity analysis 
      on invasively acquired pressure waveforms from the ascending aorta and left 
      ventricle immediately pre- and post-TAVR. Following TAVR, there were increases in 
      systolic, diastolic, mean, and pulse aortic pressures (all P<0.05). Post-TAVR 
      reservoir pressure was unchanged (54.5±12.4 versus 56.6±14.0 mm Hg, P=0.30) 
      whereas excess pressure increased 47% (29.0±10.9 versus 42.6±15.5 mm Hg, 
      P<0.001). Wave intensity analysis (arbitrary units, au) demonstrated increased 
      forward compression wave (64.9±35.5 versus 124.4±58.9, ×10(3) au, P<0.001), 
      backward compression wave (11.6±5.5 versus 14.4±6.9, ×10(3) au, P=0.01) and 
      forward expansion wave energies (43.2±27.3 versus 82.8±53.1, ×10(3) au, P<0.001). 
      Subendocardial viability ratio improved with aortic function effectively 
      unchanged post-TAVR. Increased central aortic pressure following TAVR relates to 
      increased transmitted power and energy to the proximal aorta with increased 
      excess pressure but unchanged reservoir pressure. These changes provide a 
      potential mechanism for the improved prognosis associated with relative 
      hypertension post-TAVR.

TI  - Abnormal Central Pulsatile Hemodynamics in Adolescents With Obesity: Higher 
      Aortic Forward Pressure Wave Amplitude Is Independently Associated With Greater 
      Left Ventricular Mass.
PG  - 1200-1207
AB  - We hypothesized that increased aortic forward pressure wave amplitude (Pf), which 
      is determined by characteristic impedance (Zc) in the proximal aorta, is the 
      primary hemodynamic determinant of obesity-associated higher left ventricular 
      (LV) mass in adolescents. Aortic pulsatile hemodynamics were measured 
      noninvasively in 60 healthy adolescents (age 14-19 years; 42% male; 50% black) by 
      sequential recordings of pulse waveforms via tonometry, brachial blood pressure, 
      and pulsed Doppler and diameter of the LV outflow tract using 2-dimensional 
      echocardiography. Adolescents who were overweight/obese (n=23; age 16.0±0.3 
      years; body mass index ≥85th percentile) had higher LV mass index, brachial and 
      carotid systolic blood pressure and pulse pressure, normalized Zc and Pf compared 
      with adolescents with healthy weight (n=37; 16.7±0.3 years; body mass index <85th 
      percentile, all P<0.01). In contrast, there was no difference in mean or 
      diastolic blood pressure, carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity, carotid 
      augmentation index, or aortic backward wave amplitude (all P>0.05). Stepwise 
      multiple linear regression analysis that included age, sex, race, normalized Zc, 
      and brachial systolic blood pressure revealed that body mass index (B±SE; 
      0.49±0.20, P=0.02, R(2)=0.26), aortic Pf (0.22±0.07; P<0.02, R(2) change=0.11), 
      and cardiac output (2.82±1.02, P<0.01; R(2) change=0.08) were significant 
      correlates of LV mass index (total R(2)=0.44, P<0.01). These findings suggest 
      that higher aortic Pf is a major hemodynamic determinant of increased LV mass in 
      adolescents with elevated adiposity. Improper matching between aortic diameter 
      and pulsatile flow during early systole potentially contributes to the early 
      development of LV hypertrophy in childhood obesity.

TI  - Evaluation of Nonlinear Wave Separation Method to Assess Reflection Transit Time: 
      A Virtual Patient Study.
PG  - 5551-5554
LID - 10.1109/EMBC46164.2021.9630464 [doi]
AB  - Conventional methods to calculate reflection transit time (RTT) is based on pulse 
      counter analysis. An alternative to this approach is separating forward and 
      backward components from a pulse waveform to calculate the RTT. State-of-the-art 
      in wave separation requires simultaneously measured pressure and flow velocity 
      waveforms. Practically, getting a simultaneous measurement from a single arterial 
      site has its limitations, and this has made the translation of wave separation 
      methods to clinical practice difficult. We propose a new method of wave 
      separation analysis that requires only a single pulse waveform measurement using 
      a multi-Gaussian decomposition approach. The novelty of the method is that it 
      does not require any measured or modelled flow velocity waveform. In this method, 
      the pulse waveform is decomposed into the sum of Gaussians and reconstructed 
      based on model criteria. RTT is calculated as the time difference between 
      normalized forward and backward waveform. The method's feasibility in using RTT 
      as a potential surrogate is demonstrated on 105 diverse selections of virtual 
      subjects. The results were statistically significant and had a strong correlation 
      (r>79, p<0.0001) against clinically approved artery stiffness markers such as 
      Peterson's elastic modulus (Ep), pulse wave velocity (PWV), specific stiffness 
      index (β), and arterial compliance (AC). Out of all the elasticity markers, a 
      better correlation was found against AC.Clinical Relevance-This simulation study 
      supplements the evidence for the dependence of pulse wave reflections on arterial 
      stiffness. It provides a new method to study wave reflections using only a single 
      pulse waveform.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Arterial properties influence cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. We 
      identified potential determinants of arterial function in patients with 
      rheumatoid arthritis (RA). METHODS: Relationships of traditional cardiovascular 
      risk factors and RA characteristics with arterial stiffness (pulse wave 
      velocity), wave reflection (augmentation index, reflected wave pressure, and 
      reflection magnitude), and pressure pulsatility (central systolic and pulse 
      pressure, peripheral pulse pressure, pulse pressure amplification, and forward 
      wave pressure) were identified in multivariable backward regression models among 
      177 patients without established CVD (118 white, 32 Asian, 22 black, 5 mixed 
      ancestry). RESULTS: Recorded characteristics explained 37% (pulse wave velocity) 
      to 71% (reflected wave pressure) of the variability in arterial function. These 
      factors were particularly associated with wave reflection and pressure 
      pulsatility: RA duration (p = 0.04), rheumatoid factor status (p = 0.01 to 0.03), 
      leukocyte counts (p = 0.02 to 0.05), and total cholesterol (p < 0.01 to 0.03). 
      Body mass index (p < 0.01 to 0.02) and insulin resistance (p < 0.01 to 0.01) were 
      related to reduced wave reflection and peripheral pulse pressure. Exercise (p = 
      0.02) and alcohol consumption (p < 0.01) were associated with increased pulse 
      pressure amplification and decreased peripheral pulse pressure, respectively. 
      Tumor necrosis factor-α inhibition (p < 0.01) was related to reduced pulse wave 
      velocity, and tetracycline use (p = 0.02) to decreased peripheral pulse pressure. 
      CONCLUSION: Traditional cardiovascular risk factors and disease characteristics 
      are consistently associated with vascular hemodynamic alterations in RA. The 
      relative effect of arterial stiffness, wave reflection, and pressure pulsatility 
      on CVD risk in RA needs further study.

TI  - Arterial wave reflections and ventricular-vascular interaction in patients with 
      left ventricular systolic dysfunction.
PG  - 526-32
AB  - Central aortic pressure waveform (AoPW) is the summation of a forward-traveling 
      wave generated by the left ventricle and a backward-traveling wave caused by the 
      reflection of the forward wave. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect 
      of ventricular-vascular coupling on the morphology of AoPW in chronic heart 
      failure patients with different degrees of left ventricular systolic dysfunction 
      (LVSD) using pulse wave analysis (PWA). PWA of AoPW and left ventricular (LV) 
      function were evaluated by applanation tonometry in 26 control subjects, in 12 
      patients with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤ 30%, and in 14 patients 
      with LVEF > 30%. Augmentation pressure, augmentation index, wasted energy, and 
      ejection duration were lower in patients with LVEF ≤ 30% than in those with LVEF 
      > 30% and in control subjects. Furthermore, augmentation index showed an inverse 
      correlation with Doppler mitral E-wave amplitude (r = -0.40; P = 0.04) and E/A 
      ratio (r = -0.42; P = 0.03) and a direct correlation with deceleration time of 
      mitral E-waves (r = 0.39; P = 0.04). In patients with severe LVSD (LVEF ≤ 30%), 
      aortic wave reflections negatively interfere with LV function and induce a 
      shortening of ejection duration. In contrast, AoPW is similar in patients with 
      moderate LVSD (LVEF > 30%) and in control subjects.

      beneficial for patients suffering from a variety of cardiovascular diseases, it 
      remains underutilized as a rehabilitation tool as there is no reliable way to 
      monitor the additional stress placed on the central organs. The current study 
      aimed to determine between-day reliability of central haemodynamic indices using 
      oscillometric pulse wave analysis (PWA) during progressive sub-maximal RT. 
      METHODS: Nineteen healthy young males were tested on 3 different mornings in a 
      fasted state. Central hemodynamic variables including augmentation index (AIx), 
      AIx normalized to a heart rate of 75 beats per minute (AIx@75), central systolic 
      blood pressure (cSBP), forwards (Pf) and backwards (Pb) wave reflection were 
      determined at rest, as well as during leg extension RT at 10, 15 and 20% of 
      maximal volitional contraction (MVC), and following 1 min and 5 min passive 
      recovery. RESULTS: During RT at 10, 15 and 20% MVC, the intraclass correlation 
      coefficient (ICC) values for AIx@75 (0.76-0.9), cSBP (0.74-0.78), Pf (0.75-0.82) 
      and Pb (0.75-0.83) exceeded the criteria (0.75) for excellent reliability. During 
      the 5 min recovery, the ICC values for AIx@75 (0.87-0.87), cSBP (0.69-0.7), Pf 
      (0.63-0.67) and Pb (0.63-0.66) indicated good to excellent reliability. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Clinically meaningful changes in central hemodynamic indices can be 
      obtained during resistance training using oscillometric PWA devices. This 
      technology holds potential for advancing resistance training prescription 
      guidelines for patients with overt cardiovascular diseases.

TI  - Twenty-Four-Hour Pulsatile Hemodynamics Predict Brachial Blood Pressure Response 
      to Renal Denervation in the SPYRAL HTN-OFF MED Trial.
PG  - 1506-1514
LID - 10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.121.18641 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Renal denervation (RDN) lowers blood pressure (BP), but BP response 
      is variable in individual patients. We investigated whether measures of pulsatile 
      hemodynamics, obtained during 24-hour ambulatory BP monitoring, predict BP drop 
      following RDN. METHODS: From the randomized, sham-controlled SPYRAL HTN-OFF MED 
      Pivotal trial, we performed a post hoc analysis of BP waveforms from 111 RDN 
      patients and 111 sham controls, obtained with a brachial cuff-based 
      sphygmomanometer. Waveforms were acquired during ambulatory BP monitoring at 
      diastolic BP level and processed with validated ARCSolver algorithms to derive 
      hemodynamic parameters (augmentation index; augmentation pressure; backward and 
      forward wave amplitude; estimated aortic pulse wave velocity). We investigated 
      the relationship between averaged 24-hour values at baseline and the change in 
      24-hour BP at 3 months in RDN patients, corrected for observed trends in the sham 
      group. RESULTS: There was a consistent inverse relationship between baseline 
      augmentation index/augmentation pressure/backward wave amplitude/forward wave 
      amplitude/estimated aortic pulse wave velocity and BP response to RDN: the 
      decrease in 24-hour systolic BP/diastolic BP was 7.8/5.9 (augmentation index), 
      8.0/6.3 (augmentation pressure), 6.7/5.4 (backward wave amplitude), 5.7/4.7 
      (forward wave amplitude), and 7.8/5.2 (estimated aortic pulse wave velocity) 
      mm Hg greater for patients below versus above the respective median value 
      (P<0.001 for all comparisons, respectively). Taking augmentation 
      index/augmentation pressure/backward wave amplitude/forward wave 
      amplitude/estimated aortic pulse wave velocity into account, a favorable BP 
      response following RDN, defined as a drop in 24-hour systolic blood pressure of 
      ≥5 mm Hg, could be predicted with an area under the curve of 
      0.70/0.74/0.70/0.65/0.62 (P<0.001 for all, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: These 
      results suggest that pulsatile hemodynamics, obtained during 24-hour ambulatory 
      BP monitoring, may predict BP response to RDN.

TI  - Quantification of wave reflection using peripheral blood pressure waveforms.
PG  - 309-16
LID - 10.1109/JBHI.2014.2307273 [doi]
AB  - This paper presents a novel minimally invasive method for quantifying blood 
      pressure (BP) wave reflection in the arterial tree. In this method, two 
      peripheral BP waveforms are analyzed to obtain an estimate of central aortic BP 
      waveform, which is used together with a peripheral BP waveform to compute forward 
      and backward pressure waves. These forward and backward waves are then used to 
      quantify the strength of wave reflection in the arterial tree. Two unique 
      strengths of the proposed method are that 1) it replaces highly invasive central 
      aortic BP and flow waveforms required in many existing methods by less invasive 
      peripheral BP waveforms, and 2) it does not require estimation of characteristic 
      impedance. The feasibility of the proposed method was examined in an experimental 
      swine subject under a wide range of physiologic states and in 13 cardiac surgery 
      patients. In the swine subject, the method was comparable to the reference method 
      based on central aortic BP and flow. In cardiac surgery patients, the method was 
      able to estimate forward and backward pressure waves in the absence of any 
      central aortic waveforms: on the average, the root-mean-squared error between 
      actual versus computed forward and backward pressure waves was less than 5 mmHg, 
      and the error between actual versus computed reflection index was less than 0.03.

PG  - H1408-16
LID - 10.1152/ajpheart.00647.2013 [doi]
AB  - The aim of this study is to quantify aortic backward flow (BF) using 
      phase-contrast cardiovascular magnetic resonance (PC-CMR) and to study its 
      associations with age, indexes of arterial stiffness, and geometry. Although 
      PC-CMR blood flow studies showed a simultaneous presence of BF and forward flow 
      (FF) in the ascending aorta (AA), the relationship between aortic flows and aging 
      as well as arterial stiffness and geometry in healthy volunteers has never been 
      reported. We studied 96 healthy subjects [47 women, 39 ± 15 yr old (19-79 yr)]. 
      Aortic stiffness [arch pulse wave velocity (PWVAO), AA distensibility], geometry 
      (AA diameter and arch length), and parameters related to AA BF and FF (volumes, 
      peaks, and onset times) were estimated from CMR. Applanation tonometry 
      carotid-femoral pulse-wave velocity (PWVCF), carotid augmentation index, and time 
      to return of the reflected pressure wave were assessed. Whereas FF parameters 
      remained unchanged, BF onset time shortened significantly (R(2) = 0.18, P < 
      0.0001) and BF volume and BF-to-FF peaks ratio increased significantly (R(2) = 
      0.38 and R(2) = 0.44, respectively, P < 0.0001) with aging. These two latter BF 
      indexes were also related to stiffness indexes (PWVCF, R(2) > 0.30; PWVAO, R(2) > 
      0.24; and distensibility, R(2) > 0.20, P < 0.001), augmentation index (R(2) > 
      0.20, P < 0.001), and aortic geometry (AA diameter, R(2) > 0.58; and arch length, 
      R(2) > 0.31, P < 0.001). In multivariate analysis, aortic diameter was the 
      strongest independent correlate of BF beyond age effect. In conclusion, AA BF 
      estimated using PC-CMR increased significantly in terms of magnitude and volume 
      and appeared earlier with aging and was mostly determined by aortic geometry. 
      Thus BF indexes could be relevant markers of subclinical arterial wall 
      alterations.

TI  - Arterial wave reflections and kidney function decline among persons with

      Atherosclerosis.

AB  - Differences in arterial wave reflections have been associated with increased risk 
      for heart failure and mortality. Whether these measures are also associated with 
      kidney function decline is not well established. Reflection magnitude (RM, 
      defined as the ratio of the backward wave [Pb] to that of the forward wave [Pf]), 
      augmentation index (AIx), and pulse pressure amplification (PPA) were derived 
      from radial tonometry measures among 5232 participants free of cardiovascular 
      disease who were enrolled in the Multiethnic Study of Atherosclerosis. Kidney 
      function was estimated by creatinine and cystatin C measurements, as well as 
      albumin-to-creatinine ratio. We evaluated the associations of Pb, Pf, RM, AIx, 
      and PPA with annualized estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) change and 
      rapid kidney function decline over 5 years, using generalized linear mixed models 
      and logistic regression, respectively. Of the study participants, 48% were male, 
      mean age was 62 years, mean eGFR and median albumin-to-creatinine ratio at 
      baseline were 84 mL/min/1.73 m(2) and 5.3 mg/g, respectively. In demographically 
      adjusted models, both Pb and Pf had similarly strong associations with kidney 
      function decline; compared to those in the lowest tertiles, the persons in the 
      highest tertiles of Pb and Pf had a 1.01 and 0.99 mL/min/1.73 m(2)/year faster 
      eGFR decline, respectively (P < .05). However, these associations were attenuated 
      after adjustment for systolic blood pressure. We found no significant 
      associations between RM, AIx, or PPA and kidney function decline. In conclusion, 
      the reflected and forward wave components were similarly associated with kidney 
      function decline, and these associations were explained by differences in 
      systolic blood pressure.

TI  - Ultrasound detection of altered placental vascular morphology based on 
      hemodynamic pulse wave reflection.
PG  - H1021-H1029
LID - 10.1152/ajpheart.00791.2016 [doi]
AB  - Abnormally pulsatile umbilical artery (UA) Doppler ultrasound velocity waveforms 
      are a hallmark of severe or early onset placental-mediated intrauterine growth 
      restriction (IUGR), whereas milder late onset IUGR pregnancies typically have 
      normal UA pulsatility. The diagnostic utility of these waveforms to detect 
      placental pathology is thus limited and hampered by factors outside of the 
      placental circulation, including fetal cardiac output. In view of these 
      limitations, we hypothesized that these Doppler waveforms could be more clearly 
      understood as a reflection phenomenon and that a reflected pulse pressure wave is 
      present in the UA that originates from the placenta and propagates backward along 
      the UA. To investigate this, we developed a new ultrasound approach to isolate 
      that portion of the UA Doppler waveform that arises from a pulse pressure wave 
      propagating backward along the UA. Ultrasound measurements of UA lumen diameter 
      and flow waveforms were used to decompose the observed flow waveform into its 
      forward and reflected components. Evaluation of CD1 and C57BL/6 mice at embryonic 
      day (E)15.5 and E17.5 demonstrated that the reflected waveforms diverged between 
      the strains at E17.5, mirroring known changes in the fractal geometry of 
      fetoplacental arteries at these ages. These experiments demonstrate the 
      feasibility of noninvasively measuring wave reflections that originate from the 
      fetoplacental circulation. The observed reflections were consistent with 
      theoretical predictions based on the area ratio of parent to daughters at 
      bifurcations in fetoplacental arteries suggesting that this approach could be 
      used in the diagnosis of fetoplacental vascular pathology that is prevalent in 
      human IUGR. Given that the proposed measurements represent a subset of those 
      currently used in human fetal surveillance, the adaptation of this technology 
      could extend the diagnostic utility of Doppler ultrasound in the detection of 
      placental vascular pathologies that cause IUGR.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Here, we describe 
      a novel approach to noninvasively detect microvascular changes in the 
      fetoplacental circulation using ultrasound. The technique is based on detecting 
      reflection pulse pressure waves that travel along the umbilical artery. Using a 
      proof-of-principle study, we demonstrate the feasibility of the technique in two 
      strains of experimental mice.

TI  - Cardiac Diastolic Dysfunction is Associated With Aortic Wave Reflection, but Not 
      Stiffness in a Predominantly Young-to-Middle-Aged Community Sample.
PG  - 1148-57
LID - 10.1093/ajh/hpw052 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Whether the impact of backward wave pressures (Pbs) on left 
      ventricular (LV) diastolic dysfunction (DD) antedates the effects of aortic 
      stiffness is uncertain. We compared the relative contribution of various aortic 
      hemodynamic parameters to preclinical DD in a predominantly young-to-middle-aged 
      community-based sample. METHODS: In 524 randomly selected participants of African 
      ancestry (mean age = 46.8±18.4 years), we assessed central aortic pulse pressure 
      (PPc), forward wave pressure (Pf), Pb, augmented pressure (Pa), the time-to-wave 
      reflection (Rt), and aortic pulse wave velocity (PWV) using applanation tonometry 
      (SphygmoCor software). LV mass index (LVMI), early to late transmitral velocity 
      (E/A), and E/velocity of myocardial tissue lengthening (E/e') were determined 
      using echocardiography. RESULTS: Independent of age, sex, mean arterial pressure, 
      body mass index, diabetes mellitus and/or HbA1c > 6.1%, regular smoking, regular 
      alcohol intake, treatment for hypertension, pulse rate, and LVMI; PPc (P < 
      0.002), Pb (P < 0.0005), Pa (P < 0.002), and Pf (P < 0.02), but not Rt or PWV 
      were independently associated with E/e' (but not with E/A). With adjustments for 
      confounders, PPc (P < 0.005), Pb (P < 0.002), and Pa (P < 0.001), but not Pf, Rt, 
      or PWV were independently associated with E/e' ≥ 12 (moderate-to-severe DD, n = 
      69). The independent relations between PPc and E/e' or moderate-to-severe DD were 
      not affected by adjustments for PWV, Pf, or Rt, but were abolished with 
      adjustments for Pb. CONCLUSIONS: In a predominantly young-to-middle-aged 
      community sample, the impact of Pbs on LV DD antedates the effects of aortic 
      stiffness, the time-to-wave reflection, or Pfs.

TI  - Augmentation pressure is influenced by ventricular contractility/relaxation 
      dynamics: novel mechanism of reduction of pulse pressure by nitrates.
PG  - 1050-5
LID - 10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.113.02955 [doi]
AB  - Augmentation pressure (AP), the increment in aortic pressure above its first 
      systolic shoulder, is thought to be determined mainly by pressure wave reflection 
      but could be influenced by ventricular ejection characteristics. We sought to 
      determine the mechanism by which AP is selectively reduced by nitroglycerin 
      (NTG). Simultaneous measurements of aortic pressure and flow were made at the 
      time of cardiac catheterization in 30 subjects (11 women; age, 61±13 years 
      [mean±SD]) to perform wave intensity analysis and calculate forward and backward 
      components of AP generated by the ventricle and arterial tree, respectively. 
      Measurements were made at baseline and after NTG given systemically (800 μg 
      sublingually, n=20) and locally by intracoronary infusion (1 μg/min; n=10). 
      Systemic NTG had no significant effect on first shoulder pressure but reduced 
      augmentation (and central pulse pressure) by 12.8±3.1 mm Hg (P<0.0001). This 
      resulted from a reduction in forward and backward wave components of AP by 
      7.0±2.4 and 5.8±1.3 mm Hg, respectively (each P<0.02). NTG had no significant 
      effect on the ratio of amplitudes of either backward/forward waves or 
      backward/forward compression wave energies, suggesting that effects on the 
      backward wave were largely secondary to those on the forward wave. Time to the 
      forward expansion wave was reduced (P<0.05). Intracoronary NTG decreased AP by 
      8.3±3.6 mm Hg (P<0.05) with no significant effect on the backward wave. NTG 
      reduces AP and central pulse pressure by a mechanism that is, at least in part, 
      independent of arterial reflections and relates to ventricular 
      contraction/relaxation dynamics with enhanced myocardial relaxation.

TI  - Value of Excess Pressure Integral for Predicting 15-Year All-Cause and 
      Cardiovascular Mortalities in End-Stage Renal Disease Patients.
LID - 10.1161/JAHA.117.006701 [doi]
LID - e006701
AB  - BACKGROUND: The excess pressure integral (XSPI), derived from analysis of the 
      arterial pressure curve, may be a significant predictor of cardiovascular events 
      in high-risk patients. We comprehensively investigated the prognostic value of 
      XSPI for predicting long-term mortality in end-stage renal disease patients 
      undergoing regular hemodialysis. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 267 uremic 
      patients (50.2% female; mean age 54.2±14.9 years) receiving regular hemodialysis 
      for more than 6 months were enrolled. Cardiovascular parameters were obtained by 
      echocardiography and applanation tonometry. Calibrated carotid arterial pressure 
      waveforms were analyzed according to the wave-transmission and reservoir-wave 
      theories. Multivariable Cox proportional hazard models were constructed to 
      account for age, sex, diabetes mellitus, albumin, body mass index, and 
      hemodialysis treatment adequacy. Incremental utility of the parameters to risk 
      stratification was assessed by net reclassification improvement. During a median 
      follow-up of 15.3 years, 124 deaths (46.4%) incurred. Baseline XSPI was 
      significantly predictive of all-cause (hazard ratio per 1 SD 1.4, 95% confidence 
      interval 1.15-1.70, P=0.0006) and cardiovascular mortalities (1.47, 1.18-1.84, 
      P=0.0006) after accounting for the covariates. The addition of XSPI to the base 
      prognostic model significantly improved prediction of both all-cause mortality 
      (net reclassification improvement=0.1549, P=0.0012) and cardiovascular mortality 
      (net reclassification improvement=0.1535, P=0.0033). XSPI was superior to 
      carotid-pulse wave velocity, forward and backward wave amplitudes, and left 
      ventricular ejection fraction in consideration of overall independent and 
      incremental prognostics values. CONCLUSIONS: In end-stage renal disease patients 
      undergoing regular hemodialysis, XSPI was significantly predictive of long-term 
      mortality and demonstrated an incremental value to conventional prognostic 
      factors.

TI  - Indexes of aortic pressure augmentation markedly underestimate the contribution 
      of reflected waves toward variations in aortic pressure and left ventricular 
      mass.
PG  - 540-6
LID - 10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.114.04582 [doi]
AB  - Although indexes of wave reflection enhance risk prediction, the extent to which 
      measures of aortic systolic pressure augmentation (augmented pressures [Pa] or 
      augmentation index) underestimate the effects of reflected waves on 
      cardiovascular risk is uncertain. In participants from a community sample (age 
      >16), we compared the relative contribution of reflected (backward wave pressures 
      and the reflected wave index [RI]) versus augmented (Pa and augmentation index) 
      pressure wave indexes to variations in central aortic pulse pressure (PPc; 
      n=1185), and left ventricular mass index (LVMI; n=793). Aortic hemodynamics and 
      LVMI were determined using radial applanation tonometry (SphygmoCor) and 
      echocardiography. Independent of confounders, RI and backward wave pressures 
      contributed more than forward wave pressures, whereas Pa and augmentation index 
      contributed less than incident wave pressure to variations in PPc (P<0.0001 for 
      comparison of partial r values). In those <50 years of age, while backward wave 
      pressures (partial r=0.28, P<0.0001) contributed more than forward wave pressures 
      (partial r=0.15, P<0.001; P<0.05 for comparison of r values), Pa (partial r=0.13, 
      P<0.005) contributed to a similar extent as incident wave pressure (partial 
      r=0.22, P<0.0001) to variations in LVMI. Furthermore, in those ≥50 years of age, 
      backward wave pressures (partial r=0.21, P<0.0001), but not forward wave 
      pressures (P=0.98), while incident wave pressure (partial r=0.23, P<0.0001), but 
      not Pa (P=0.80) were associated with LVMI. Pa and augmentation index 
      underestimated the effect of wave reflection on PPc and LVMI in both men and 
      women. Thus, as compared with relations between indexes of aortic pressure 
      augmentation and PPc or LVMI, strikingly better relations are noted between 
      aortic wave reflection and PPc or LVMI.

TI  - Limitations of augmentation index in the assessment of wave reflection in

PG  - e59371

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Augmentation index (AIx) is widely used as a measure of wave 
      reflection. We compared the relationship between AIx and age, height and sex with 
      'gold standard' measures of wave reflection derived from measurements of pressure 
      and flow to establish how well AIx measures wave reflection. MATERIALS AND 
      METHODS: Measurements of carotid pressure and flow velocity were made in the 
      carotid artery of 65 healthy normotensive individuals (age 21-78 yr; 43 male) and 
      pulse wave analysis, wave intensity analysis and wave separation was performed; 
      waveforms were classified into type A, B or C. AIx, the time of the first 
      shoulder (T(s)), wave reflection index (WRI) and the ratio of backward to forward 
      pressure (P(b)/P(f)) were calculated. RESULTS: AIx did not correlate with log WRI 
      or P(b)/P(f). When AIx was restricted to positive values AIx and log WRI were 
      positively correlated (r = 0.33; p = 0.04). In contrast log WRI and P(b)/P(f) 
      were closely correlated (r = 0.66; p<0.001). There was no correlation between the 
      T(s) and the timing of Pb or the reflected wave identified by wave intensity 
      analysis. Wave intensity analysis showed that the morphology of type C waveforms 
      (negative AIx) was principally due to a forward travelling (re-reflected) 
      decompression wave in mid-systole. AIx correlated positively with age, inversely 
      with height and was higher in women. In contrast log WRI and P(b)/P(f) showed 
      negative associations with age, were unrelated to height and did not differ 
      significantly by gender. CONCLUSIONS: AIx has serious limitations as a measure of 
      wave reflection. Negative AIx values derived from Type C waves should not be used 
      as estimates of wave reflection magnitude.

TI  - Reliability of pulse waveform separation analysis responses to an orthostatic 
      challenge.
PG  - 176-182
LID - 10.1038/s41440-017-0005-1 [doi]
AB  - Cardiovascular autonomic nervous system function can be assessed using an 
      orthostatic challenge to induce arterial wave reflection. While arterial 
      reflection is typically estimated using a central augmentation index, a superior 
      estimation can be obtained using pulse wave separation analysis to estimate the 
      aortic backward pressure wave (Pb). However, to be of value in a clinical or 
      research setting, an assessment tool must be precise (reliable). Therefore, this 
      study sought to determine the measurement precision of Pb responses to a modified 
      tilt-table test. Twenty healthy adults (26.4 year (SD 5.2), 24.7 kg/m(2) (SD 
      3.8), 55% female) were tested in a fasted state on three different mornings 
      separated by a maximum of seven days. Pressure waveforms were recorded on the 
      left arm, and aortic waveforms were generated using a generalized transfer 
      function. Subsequently, a physiologic flow waveform was assumed to separate the 
      aortic pressure wave into its forward and timing-independent backward (Pb) 
      components. The criterion intra-class correlation coefficient of ≥0.75 was 
      exceeded at baseline (0.79), following a 5-min tilt (0.75), and following a 5-min 
      recovery from tilt (0.75). The standard error of measurement was 7%. These 
      findings indicate that in a healthy cohort, the Pb response to an orthostatic 
      challenge can be assessed with acceptable precision. The next step is to 
      determine the sensitivity (validity) of this technique in identifying 
      cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction in patient groups.

TI  - Doppler indexes of left ventricular systolic and diastolic function in relation 
      to haemodynamic load components in a general population.
PG  - 867-875
LID - 10.1097/HJH.0000000000001623 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The contribution of central pulsatility to left ventricular (LV) 
      dysfunction might be mediated by the haemodynamic loads of forward (Pf) and 
      backward (Pb) pulse waves. We investigated the relation between echocardiographic 
      indexes of LV function and pulsatile loads derived by wave separation analysis 
      (WSA). METHODS: In 755 participants, we assessed LV dimensions, transmitral blood 
      flow and mitral annular tissue velocities. We derived central pulse pressure 
      (cPP) from radial tonometric recordings and calculated Pf, Pb and their ratio 
      (reflection magnitude) using an automated, pressure-based WSA algorithm. Despite 
      good quality recordings, WSA failed to derive Pf and Pb in 139 participants 
      (18.4%), in particular in older women with unfavourable haemodynamics. Thus, our 
      analysis included 616 participants (46.1% women; mean age, 49.2 years). RESULTS: 
      Age and age explained most of the variance in cPP (36.9%), Pf (18.6%), Pb (41.5%) 
      and reflection magnitude (36.7%; P < 0.0001) and altered the direct correlation 
      between Pf and Pb (Pint < 0.0001). Haemodynamic loads were independently 
      associated with sex, BMI, heart rate, mean arterial pressure, history of diabetes 
      and use of antihypertensive drugs. In multivariable-adjusted analyses, 
      transmitral velocities and E/e' ratio increased with higher cPP, Pf and Pb in men 
      and women. We also observed an age-dependent association of LV radial strain with 
      cPP, Pf and Pb. CONCLUSION: The commercial WSA algorithm holds limited clinical 
      utility given its low feasibility in older participants with unfavourable 
      haemodynamics. LV function indexes were similarly associated with Pf and Pb, 
      favouring the use of the composite cPP for prediction of LV dysfunction.

TI  - Impact of Diabetes Mellitus on Ventricular Structure, Arterial Stiffness, and 
      Pulsatile Hemodynamics in Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction.
PG  - e011457

LID - e011457
AB  - Background Heterogeneity in the underlying processes that contribute to heart 
      failure with preserved ejection fraction ( HF p EF ) is increasingly recognized. 
      Diabetes mellitus is a frequent comorbidity in HF p EF , but its impact on left 
      ventricular and arterial structure and function in HF p EF is unknown. Methods 
      and Results We assessed the impact of diabetes mellitus on left ventricular 
      cellular and interstitial hypertrophy (assessed with cardiac magnetic resonance 
      imaging, including T1 mapping pregadolinium and postgadolinium administration), 
      arterial stiffness (assessed with arterial tonometry), and pulsatile arterial 
      hemodynamics (assessed with in-office pressure-flow analyses and 24-hour 
      ambulatory monitoring) among 53 subjects with HF p EF (32 diabetic and 21 
      nondiabetic subjects). Despite few differences in clinical characteristics, 
      diabetic subjects with HFpEF exhibited a markedly greater left ventricular mass 
      index (78.1 [95% CI , 70.4-85.9] g versus 63.6 [95% CI , 55.8-71.3] g; P=0.0093) 
      and indexed extracellular volume (23.6 [95% CI , 21.2-26.1] mL/m(2) versus 16.2 
      [95% CI , 13.1-19.4] mL/m(2); P=0.0008). Pronounced aortic stiffening was also 
      observed in the diabetic group (carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity, 11.86 [95% 
      CI , 10.4-13.1] m/s versus 8.8 [95% CI , 7.5-10.1] m/s; P=0.0027), with an 
      adverse pulsatile hemodynamic profile characterized by increased oscillatory 
      power (315 [95% CI , 258-373] mW versus 190 [95% CI , 144-236] mW; P=0.0007), 
      aortic characteristic impedance (0.154 [95% CI , 0.124-0.183] mm Hg/mL per second 
      versus 0.096 [95% CI , 0.072-0.121] mm Hg/mL per second; P=0.0024), and forward 
      (59.5 [95% CI , 52.8-66.1] mm Hg versus 40.1 [95% CI , 31.6-48.6] mm Hg; 
      P=0.0010) and backward (19.6 [95% CI , 16.2-22.9] mm Hg versus 14.1 [95% CI , 
      10.9-17.3] mm Hg; P=0.0169) wave amplitude. Abnormal pulsatile hemodynamics were 
      also evident in 24-hour ambulatory monitoring, despite the absence of significant 
      differences in 24-hour systolic blood pressure between the groups. Conclusions 
      Diabetes mellitus is a key determinant of left ventricular remodeling, arterial 
      stiffness, adverse pulsatile hemodynamics, and ventricular-arterial interactions 
      in HF p EF . Clinical Trial Registration URL : https://www.clinicaltrials.gov .

TI  - Enhanced Aortic Reflected Wave Magnitude Accounts for the Impact of Female Gender 
      on Aortic Pressure Augmentation in a Group of African Ancestry.
PG  - 781-790
LID - 10.1093/ajh/hpx042 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Aortic reflected wave magnitude (RM) may not account for sex-specific 
      differences in aortic pressure augmentation in Caucasians. However, aortic 
      reflected waves are greater in groups of African descent than other ethnic 
      groups. We determined whether RM or alternative factors explain the impact of sex 
      on aortic augmented pressure (Pa) in participants of African ancestry. METHODS: 
      We assessed aortic function (radial applanation tonometry, SphygmoCor) in 1,197 
      randomly recruited community participants of African ancestry (age ≥ 16 years). 
      Aortic forward (Pf) and backward (Pb) wave separation was performed assuming an 
      aortic triangular flow wave validated against aortic velocity measurements. 
      RESULTS: Across the adult lifespan, women had greater multivariate-adjusted 
      augmentation index (AIx) and Pa. This was associated with multivariate-adjusted 
      age-related increases in Pb, RM (Pb/Pf), and time to the peak of Pf and decreases 
      in backward wave foot time; but not increases in Pf. With adjustors, Pa was 
      associated with female gender (β-coefficient = 3.81 ± 0.34), a relationship which 
      was markedly attenuated by adjustments for RM (β-coefficient = 1.78 ± 0.31, P < 
      0.0001 vs. without adjustments for RM), and Pb (β-coefficient = 2.05 ± 0.19, P < 
      0.0001 vs. without adjustments for Pb), but not by adjustments for Pf, time to 
      the peak of Pf, or backward wave foot time. Similarly, AIx was associated with 
      female gender, a relationship which was markedly attenuated by adjustments for 
      RM, Pb, and backward wave foot time, but not alternative factors. CONCLUSIONS: In 
      contrast to reports in alternative populations, the relationship between aortic 
      pressure augmentation and female gender in participants of African descent is 
      accounted for mainly by increases in RM.

TI  - Self-reported sitting time is associated with higher pressure from wave 
      reflections independent of physical activity levels in healthy young adults.
PG  - 1017-23
LID - 10.1093/ajh/hpt053 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Time spent in sedentary pursuits such as sitting (SIT) is associated 
      with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease independent of physical activity 
      (PA). The purpose of this study was to examine the associations of PA and SIT 
      with central hemodynamic burden in young adults. METHODS: Aortic pressure 
      waveforms were obtained using radial applanation tonometry and a generalized 
      transfer function in 70 young healthy men (n = 41) and women (n = 29) (mean age = 
      23±1 years; body mass index = 24±1kg/m(2)). A wave separation technique that uses 
      a physiologic pseudoaortic flow waveform was used to derive incident/forward wave 
      pressure (Pf) and reflected/backward wave pressure (Pb). Levels of PA (metabolic 
      equivalent, minutes per week) and SIT (sitting time per day) were obtained by 
      self-report using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire. RESULTS: A 
      negative correlation existed between PA and Pf (r = -0.30; P < 0.05) and Pb (r = 
      -0.36; P < 0.05). A positive correlation existed between SIT and Pf (r = 0.39; P 
      < 0.05) and Pb (r = 0.44; P < 0.05). According to results from multiple 
      regression, after adjusting for potential confounders (age, sex, height, heart 
      rate, mean pressure) and PA, associations between SIT and Pf (P < 0.05) and SIT 
      and Pb (P < 0.05) remained. CONCLUSIONS: SIT is associated with higher forward 
      wave pressure and backward wave pressure, 2 novel hemodynamic correlates of 
      cardiovascular disease risk and target organ damage, in young apparently healthy 
      men and women. This association is independent of PA.
